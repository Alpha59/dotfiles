# Document software running, testing, and debugging procedures for local, beta, prod in Service README files.
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to document the procedures for running, testing, and debugging the software in local, beta, and production environments within the service's README file, **So That** team members have a clear and consistent reference for how to operate the software across environments.

This story focuses on creating comprehensive documentation in the serviceâ€™s README files that explains how to run, test, and debug the software in different environments (local, beta, and production). The README should provide specific instructions for each environment, covering setup, testing frameworks, log management, debugging procedures, and any environment-specific configurations.

### Vision
By documenting running, testing, and debugging procedures for all environments in the README files, we create a consistent resource for developers, testers, and operations teams. This ensures that everyone knows how to run the software, execute tests, and debug issues in each environment, reducing confusion and errors during the development and release lifecycle.

### Background
Operating software in different environments (local, beta, and production) often requires specific procedures for setup, testing, and debugging. Each environment may have different configurations, logging levels, and testing frameworks. Without proper documentation, developers and operators may struggle to understand how to work effectively in each environment. Providing this information in the service's README file ensures that it is easily accessible and up to date.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to add detailed sections to the README files of each service, documenting the steps required to run, test, and debug the software in the local, beta, and production environments. This will serve as a standardized reference for team members to consult when working with the service in different stages of the release lifecycle.

## Details

The README file will be structured into three main sections: **Running**, **Testing**, and **Debugging**, with subsections for each environment: **Local**, **Beta**, and **Production**.

### 1. Running the Software

This section of the README should explain how to run the software in different environments, including the necessary setup, environment variables, and commands to start the service.

#### 1.1 Running the Software Locally
```markdown
### Running Locally

1. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install   # Node.js example
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Python example
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   You will need to set the following environment variables for local development:
   ```bash
   export ENV=local
   export DB_HOST=localhost
   export DB_PORT=5432
   export API_KEY=local-api-key
   ```

3. **Run the service**:
   Start the service locally with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # Node.js example
   python app.py  # Python example
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   After the service starts, it will be available at:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
```

#### 1.2 Running the Software in Beta
```markdown
### Running in Beta Environment

1. **Connect to Beta Infrastructure**:
   Ensure you have the correct access to the beta environment infrastructure.

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   The beta environment requires the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ENV=beta
   export DB_HOST=beta-db.example.com
   export DB_PORT=5432
   export API_KEY=beta-api-key
   ```

3. **Deploy to Beta**:
   Deploy the service using your CI/CD pipeline:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch   # Automatically triggers beta deployment
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   The beta application is available at:
   ```bash
   https://beta.example.com
   ```
```

#### 1.3 Running the Software in Production
```markdown
### Running in Production

1. **Environment Variables**:
   Production requires specific environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ENV=prod
   export DB_HOST=prod-db.example.com
   export DB_PORT=5432
   export API_KEY=prod-api-key
   ```

2. **Deployment**:
   Deploy the service to production via your CI/CD pipeline:
   ```bash
   git push origin main   # Automatically triggers production deployment
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   The production application is available at:
   ```bash
   https://example.com
   ```
```

### 2. Testing the Software

This section outlines how to run the tests for the software in different environments, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

#### 2.1 Testing Locally
```markdown
### Running Tests Locally

1. **Unit Tests**:
   Run the unit tests locally using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run test   # Node.js example
   pytest         # Python example
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**:
   Set up any required services (e.g., databases, API mocks) and run integration tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration   # Node.js example
   ```

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   Use the following command to run end-to-end tests locally:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```
```

#### 2.2 Testing in Beta
```markdown
### Running Tests in Beta Environment

1. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
   These tests are automatically executed by the CI pipeline after deployment to beta.

2. **End-to-End Tests**:
   You can trigger end-to-end tests in the beta environment using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e --env=beta
   ```
```

#### 2.3 Testing in Production
```markdown
### Running Tests in Production

1. **Pre-Deployment Tests**:
   Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests should be run in the beta environment before deploying to production.

2. **Post-Deployment Smoke Tests**:
   After deploying to production, run a set of smoke tests to verify that key functionality is working as expected:
   ```bash
   npm run test:smoke --env=prod
   ```
```

### 3. Debugging the Software

This section provides debugging instructions for each environment, explaining how to access logs, set breakpoints, and troubleshoot issues.

#### 3.1 Debugging Locally
```markdown
### Debugging Locally

1. **Enable Debug Mode**:
   To enable debug logs locally, set the following environment variable:
   ```bash
   export LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

2. **Access Logs**:
   Logs will be printed directly to the console during local development.

3. **Debugging with Breakpoints**:
   If you're using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, set breakpoints in the code and run the service in debug mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # or start your Python/Node.js server in debug mode
   ```
   Use the debugger to inspect variables and step through the code.
```

#### 3.2 Debugging in Beta
```markdown
### Debugging in Beta

1. **Enable Debug Mode in Beta**:
   You can enable debug logs in the beta environment by setting the following environment variable:
   ```bash
   export LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

2. **Access Beta Logs**:
   Access logs from the beta environment using the following tools:
   - **AWS CloudWatch**: Navigate to the CloudWatch logs for the beta environment.
   - **Kibana**: Use Kibana to search and filter logs by severity level.

3. **Debugging API Requests**:
   Use API request tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to simulate requests and examine the responses in the beta environment.
```

#### 3.3 Debugging in Production
```markdown
### Debugging in Production

1. **Enable Warning and Error Logs**:
   In production, only warning and error logs are enabled by default. To view logs, ensure the following variable is set:
   ```bash
   export LOG_LEVEL=warning
   ```

2. **Access Production Logs**:
   Access production logs via:
   - **AWS CloudWatch**: View logs from production services.
   - **Kibana**: Use Kibana to filter and search logs by severity.

3. **Monitoring Tools**:
   Use **Datadog** or **Prometheus** to monitor system health and detect anomalies in production.
```
