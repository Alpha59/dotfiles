# Create and provide links to runbook for access or permissions for consuming dependent services
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to create a runbook with links and documentation that provide clear steps to request access or permissions for consuming dependent services, **So That** teams can follow a standardized process for gaining access and avoid delays or misconfigurations.

This story focuses on developing and organizing a detailed runbook that outlines how to request, configure, and manage access and permissions to services that are dependencies in the system. It provides step-by-step instructions and links to relevant tools and policies.

### Vision
By creating a well-documented runbook for managing access and permissions for dependent services, we streamline the process of granting access, reducing errors, and ensuring compliance with security best practices. This minimizes downtime and ensures that all teams can consume services efficiently and securely.

### Background
Access and permissions for services must be handled securely and consistently to prevent unauthorized access, maintain system security, and minimize the risk of disruptions. Clear documentation on how to request access, what permissions are required, and how to configure them is essential to avoid confusion and delays when interacting with dependent services.

### Runbook for Access and Permissions for Consuming Dependent Services

---

#### 1. **Overview**

This runbook provides detailed steps for requesting access and permissions to consume dependent services. It includes links to tools and systems for managing access and troubleshooting common access issues.

- **Primary Audience**: Developers, DevOps, and Operations teams.
- **Goal**: Ensure a standardized and secure approach to managing access to dependent services.

#### 2. **Steps for Requesting Access and Permissions**

##### Step 1: Identify the Dependent Service
Before requesting access, confirm the exact service, API, or system for which you need permissions. Examples include:

- **AWS Services**: S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, RDS
- **Internal APIs**: Inventory API, Payment Gateway, Notification Service
- **External APIs**: Third-party APIs such as payment processors or authentication providers

##### Step 2: Determine Required Permissions
For each service, identify the minimum permissions required based on the operations you need to perform. Permissions should follow the **principle of least privilege**, ensuring only necessary permissions are granted.

- **AWS IAM**: Check the specific IAM policies needed (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `lambda:InvokeFunction`).
- **Internal Services**: Check if there are specific user roles (e.g., `Admin`, `Reader`, `Writer`) for interacting with internal services.

##### Step 3: Request Access via IT or Permissions Management Tool
Use the appropriate access management tool or contact the IT team to request access. Provide all necessary information, including:

- Service or API name
- Required permission levels or roles
- Justification for access
- Timeframe for access (if temporary access is required)

**Tools to use**:
- **AWS IAM Console**: For AWS services permissions.

- **Internal Permissions Management System**: For internal APIs or services.
  [Link to Permissions Request System](#) _(Insert internal link here)_

- **External APIs**: For third-party services, follow the API provider's process for requesting access keys and permissions.

##### Step 4: Confirm Access and Permissions
Once access has been granted, verify that the permissions are correct. Attempt to use the service and ensure that no `403 Forbidden` or `Access Denied` errors are encountered. For AWS services, check permissions via the **IAM Policy Simulator**.

##### Step 5: Report Access Issues
If access has been granted but you encounter issues, troubleshoot by:

- **Checking Logs**: Review application or service logs for detailed error messages.
- **Verifying Policies**: Use tools like the **IAM Policy Simulator** to confirm that the required permissions are active.
- **Contacting Support**: Reach out to the service owner or IT team for assistance.

#### 3. **Access for AWS Services**

**General AWS Access Setup**:
1. **Create an IAM Role or User**: Ensure the correct IAM roles or users are in place with specific permissions for each AWS service.
2. **Attach Necessary Policies**: Add the required managed policies or create custom policies based on the service being consumed.

   **Example**: For accessing an S3 bucket, attach the ` policy:
   ```json
   {
     'Version': '2012-10-17',
     'Statement': [
       {
         'Effect': 'Allow',
         'Action': 's3:GetObject',
         'Resource': 'arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*'
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Requesting Access for Specific AWS Services**:

- **S3**: Use [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) to request S3 bucket access. Example permissions include `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject`, etc.

- **DynamoDB**: Use [AWS DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home) and ensure permissions like `dynamodb:GetItem` or `dynamodb:Query` are granted.

- **Lambda**: Use [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) to ensure permissions like `lambda:InvokeFunction` are attached.

#### 4. **Access for Internal Services**

**Requesting Access to Internal APIs**:
1. **Request Permissions via Internal Permissions Management System**:
   [Link to Internal Permissions Tool](#) _(Insert internal link here)_

   - **Example Permissions**: For the Inventory API, request the `Reader` role if you need read-only access to inventory data, or the `Writer` role if you need to update inventory information.

**API Key Generation**:
- If an API key is required for authentication, request an API key from the internal permissions management system or contact the API owner.
- Example format for API key request:
   ```json
   {
     'api_key': '1234abcd-5678efgh-91011ijklm'
   }
   ```

---

#### 5. **Access for External Services**

**Requesting Access to Third-Party APIs**:
1. **Follow the External API Provider's Documentation**:
   Obtain API keys or OAuth tokens as required by the third-party service provider.

   Example for requesting access to a payment gateway API:
   - Go to [Payment Gateway Provider](#) _(Insert link here)_.
   - Follow the documentation to request API access and configure keys.

---

#### 6. **Common Access Issues and Resolutions**

- **403 Forbidden or Access Denied**:
   - **Cause**: Missing permissions or incorrect IAM policies.
   - **Solution**: Verify IAM roles, policies, or API key configuration. Use the [IAM Policy Simulator](https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/home/index.jsp) to confirm permissions.

- **API Key Expired**:
   - **Cause**: API keys have an expiration date and may need to be rotated.
   - **Solution**: Request a new API key from the permissions management system or third-party provider.

- **Authentication Failures**:
   - **Cause**: Incorrect configuration or missing credentials.
   - **Solution**: Ensure credentials are configured properly in your environment or CI/CD pipelines.

#### 7. **Supporting Documents**

- **AWS Access and Permission Documentation**:
