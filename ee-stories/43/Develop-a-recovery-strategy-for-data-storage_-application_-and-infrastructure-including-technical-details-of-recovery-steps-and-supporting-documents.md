# Develop a recovery strategy for data storage, application, and infrastructure including technical details of recovery steps and supporting documents
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to develop a recovery strategy for data storage, applications, and infrastructure, **So That** we can ensure business continuity and minimize downtime in the event of a failure, disaster, or service outage.

This story focuses on creating a detailed, comprehensive recovery strategy that encompasses data storage, application recovery, and infrastructure resilience. It includes technical steps for backup, restoration, failover, and recovery for each layer of the system and supporting documents to ensure clear communication and execution during recovery.

### Vision
By developing a robust recovery strategy, we ensure that in the event of system failures, data loss, or infrastructure outages, the business can restore critical operations efficiently, minimizing downtime and preventing data corruption. This provides a clear and systematic process for recovering all aspects of the infrastructure.

### Background
A disaster recovery strategy is essential for maintaining business operations in the face of unexpected failures such as system crashes, hardware failures, software bugs, or natural disasters. This strategy must include plans for recovering data, restarting applications, and restoring infrastructure, all while adhering to specific Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs).

## Details

### 1. **Recovery Strategy Overview**

#### 1.1 **Key Terms**
   - **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. Defines how often data backups should occur to meet business needs.
   - **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time to restore operations after a failure or disaster. Defines how quickly the business needs to recover services.

#### 1.2 **Scope of Recovery Strategy**
   - **Data Storage**: Ensure that data stored in databases, object storage, and other persistence layers can be restored with minimal data loss.
   - **Application Layer**: Ensure that the applications and services can be redeployed and restored to functional status quickly.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: Ensure that the infrastructure (compute, networking, etc.) can be restored or fail over to alternate resources seamlessly.

### 2. **Data Storage Recovery**

#### 2.1 **Data Backup Strategy**
   - **Backup Frequency**: Define regular, automated backup schedules for all data storage systems:
     - **Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**: Daily full backups with point-in-time recovery enabled for critical databases.
     - **NoSQL Databases (e.g., DynamoDB, MongoDB)**: Use periodic snapshots with incremental backups, and enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) if supported.
     - **Object Storage (e.g.,  S3)**: Enable versioning for critical buckets and use lifecycle policies to create and retain backups in different regions.
   - **Offsite Backups**: Store copies of all backups in a different AWS region or external storage for disaster recovery (e.g., use ** S3 Cross-Region Replication** or **AWS Backup**).

   Example of setting up daily MySQL backups with AWS Backup:
   ```bash
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan-name 'DailyMySQLBackup'      --rules '[{\'RuleName\':\'DailyBackup\',\'TargetBackupVaultName\':\'MyBackupVault\',\'ScheduleExpression\':\'cron(0 0 * * ? *)\',\'StartWindowMinutes\':60,\'CompletionWindowMinutes\':180}]'
   ```

#### 2.2 **Data Restoration Steps**
   - **Relational Databases**:
     1. Identify the most recent full backup and any incremental backups or transaction logs.
     2. Restore the database from the backup.
     3. Apply any transaction logs to achieve point-in-time recovery, ensuring minimal data loss.
     4. Validate the integrity of the restored database.

   Example for restoring a MySQL RDS database:
   ```bash
   aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time --source-db-instance-identifier mydbinstance --target-db-instance-identifier restored-dbinstance --restore-time 2024-09-10T00:00:00Z
   ```

   - **NoSQL Databases (DynamoDB)**:
     1. Identify the necessary snapshot or point-in-time backup.
     2. Restore the table and confirm data consistency.
     3. Ensure replication to alternate regions is in place.

   Example to restore DynamoDB from a backup:
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb restore-table-from-backup --target-table-name restoredTable --backup-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-id:table/myTable/backup/0154321
   ```

   - **Object Storage ( S3)**:
     1. Identify the version of the object to restore.
     2. Restore the object or entire bucket.

   Example for restoring a specific version of an S3 object:
   ```bash
   aws s3api restore-object --bucket my-bucket --key my-object --version-id objectVersionID
   ```

### 3. **Application Recovery**

#### 3.1 **Application Deployment and Failover**
   - **Stateless Applications**: Use automation (e.g., **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **Kubernetes**, **ECS**/Fargate) to redeploy application containers and services. These should be redeployed from container images stored in ** ECR** or **DockerHub**.

   - **Stateful Applications**: For applications with state, ensure databases and external state sources (e.g., Redis, Elasticsearch) are restored first before deploying the application.

   Example ECS service redeployment:
   ```bash
   aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment
   ```

#### 3.2 **Multi-Region and Auto-Scaling**
   - Implement **multi-region failover** for critical applications by replicating workloads across multiple AWS regions and using **Route 53** for DNS failover.
   - Ensure applications can auto-scale to handle recovery from infrastructure failures (e.g., using **AWS Auto Scaling**).

   Example configuration for Route 53 failover:
   ```json
   {
     'Comment': 'Update Route53 to handle failover',
     'Changes': [
       {
         'Action': 'UPSERT',
         'ResourceRecordSet': {
           'Name': 'myapp.example.com',
           'Type': 'A',
           'Failover': 'PRIMARY',
           'ResourceRecords': [{ 'Value': '10.0.0.1' }],
           'SetIdentifier': 'Primary Region',
           'TTL': 300,
           'HealthCheckId': 'my-health-check-id'
         }
       },
       {
         'Action': 'UPSERT',
         'ResourceRecordSet': {
           'Name': 'myapp.example.com',
           'Type': 'A',
           'Failover': 'SECONDARY',
           'ResourceRecords': [{ 'Value': '10.1.0.1' }],
           'SetIdentifier': 'Secondary Region',
           'TTL': 300
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### 4. **Infrastructure Recovery**

#### 4.1 **Automated Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like **AWS CloudFormation**, **Terraform**, or **AWS CDK** to automatically provision and restore infrastructure.
   - Ensure that all critical infrastructure components (VPCs, EC2 instances, networking configurations) are defined in code and can be redeployed as needed.

   Example Terraform command to redeploy infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

#### 4.2 **High Availability and Redundancy**
   - **Auto Scaling Groups**: Ensure auto-scaling groups are in place for compute instances, allowing automatic recovery from instance failures.
   - **Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs)**: Implement ELBs to balance traffic across multiple instances, ensuring redundancy.
   - **Cross-AZ and Cross-Region Failover**: Ensure that infrastructure is deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) or regions, with failover configurations in place.

#### 4.3 **Networking Recovery**
   - **VPC Peering and VPNs**: Ensure that Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) are configured for peering, and VPN connections can be restored or failed over to alternate endpoints.
   - **DNS Failover**: Use Route 53 health checks and DNS failover to reroute traffic to healthy regions during outages.

### 5. **Testing and Validation**

#### 5.1 **Regular Disaster Recovery (DR) Drills**
   - Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to test the effectiveness of the recovery strategy. Simulate outages or failures and ensure recovery steps are followed.
   - Validate that RPO and RTO goals are met during recovery testing.

#### 5.2 **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Set up monitoring and alerts using **CloudWatch**, **Prometheus**, or other monitoring tools to track system health, data backup success, and infrastructure status.
