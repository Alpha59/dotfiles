# Respond to users with error messages that correctly identify issues and steps to resolve
### Summary
**As a** Software Engineer, **I want** to respond to users with error messages that correctly identify issues and provide clear steps to resolve them, **So That** users can understand the problem, take appropriate action, and resolve the issue efficiently.

This story focuses on enhancing error messages provided by the system to ensure they are descriptive, helpful, and actionable. The goal is to improve user experience by providing error details that guide users through troubleshooting steps or offer clear information on what caused the error and how to address it.

### Vision
By implementing clear and actionable error messages, we improve the overall user experience and reduce the frustration caused by ambiguous or generic error notifications. Providing clear resolution steps helps users address issues promptly, potentially reducing support tickets and service interruptions.

### Background
Users often encounter errors during system interaction, and poorly crafted error messages can lead to confusion and frustration. By ensuring error messages are specific, provide context, and include clear resolution steps, we can empower users to troubleshoot issues independently or provide necessary details to support teams for faster resolution.

## Details

### 1. **Error Categorization**
   - **User Errors**: Errors caused by incorrect input or actions taken by the user (e.g., invalid form submissions, incorrect credentials).
   - **System Errors**: Errors due to system issues such as service unavailability, internal server errors, or timeout issues.
   - **Validation Errors**: Errors that occur due to failed data validation, such as missing required fields or improper formatting.

### 2. **Best Practices for Crafting Clear Error Messages**
   - **Be Specific**: Error messages should clearly describe what went wrong, without being overly technical. Avoid generic messages like 'An error occurred.'
   - **Explain the Cause**: Provide users with a brief explanation of why the error happened. This helps users understand whether the issue was caused by their input or something else.
   - **Offer Resolution Steps**: Include actionable steps that users can take to resolve the issue. If the error is caused by user input, guide them on how to fix it. If it’s a system issue, inform them of what they should do next (e.g., retry later or contact support).
   - **Avoid Jargon**: Use language that non-technical users can easily understand. Avoid using technical terms unless absolutely necessary.
   - **Prioritize Security**: Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information, especially when dealing with authentication or security-related issues.

### 3. **Examples of Improved Error Messages**

#### 3.1 **User Error: Invalid Input**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Invalid input.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'The email address you entered is invalid. Please enter a valid email address in the format: user@example.com.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Ensure there are no spaces, and the email address includes the '@' symbol and a valid domain name.'
#### 3.2 **User Error: Missing Required Fields**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Please fill in all required fields.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'The 'Address' field is required. Please provide your full address before proceeding.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Enter your street address, city, and postal code, and try submitting the form again.'

#### 3.3 **User Error: Password Mismatch**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Passwords do not match.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'The passwords you entered do not match. Please ensure both password fields contain the same value.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Re-enter the same password in both fields, making sure there are no typing mistakes.'

#### 3.4 **System Error: Server Timeout**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Request timed out.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'The server is taking longer than expected to respond. This might be due to high traffic.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Please wait a few moments and try again. If the problem persists, contact support at support@company.com.'

#### 3.5 **System Error: Service Unavailable**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Service unavailable.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'Our service is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Please try again later. We expect to be back online by 3:00 PM. If you continue to experience issues, contact our support team.'

#### 3.6 **Validation Error: Incorrect Data Format**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Invalid date format.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'The date you entered is not in the correct format. Please use the format MM/DD/YYYY.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Ensure the date includes two digits for the month and day, and four digits for the year (e.g., 09/15/2024).'

#### 3.7 **Authentication Error: Invalid Credentials**
   - **Original Error Message**: 'Login failed.'
   - **Improved Error Message**:
     - **Message**: 'The email or password you entered is incorrect.'
     - **Resolution**: 'Please check your email address and password, and try again. If you’ve forgotten your password, click the 'Forgot Password' link to reset it.'

### 4. **Steps to Implement Improved Error Messaging**

#### 4.1 **Error Handling Mechanisms**
   - **Frontend**: Ensure that error messages are displayed prominently, near the form or input field where the error occurred. Use contextual error handling, such as highlighting the incorrect field.
   - **Backend**: On the server side, ensure that meaningful error messages are returned in the API response. Structure error responses with both a **code** and **message** to help developers debug while providing user-friendly messages to the end-user.
   - Example API error response format:
     ```json
     {
       'errorCode': 'INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT',
       'message': 'The email address you entered is invalid. Please use a valid format like user@example.com.',
       'resolution': 'Ensure the email contains '@' and a valid domain.'
     }
     ```

#### 4.2 **Localization and Accessibility**
   - **Localization**: Ensure that error messages are localized for users in different regions or languages. Use translation services to provide messages in multiple languages.
   - **Accessibility**: Make sure that error messages are accessible to users with disabilities, ensuring that error alerts are properly read by screen readers and are clearly visible for users with visual impairments.

#### 4.3 **User-Friendly Error Codes for Support**
   - In cases where the error cannot be resolved by the user, provide an error code or reference ID that the user can give to customer support.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       'errorCode': '500-INTERNAL-SRV',
       'message': 'An unexpected error occurred on the server.',
       'resolution': 'Please contact support and provide error code 500-INTERNAL-SRV.'
     }
     ```

#### 4.4 **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Ensure that all errors, especially system-level errors, are logged in the backend with relevant details (e.g., stack trace, user actions leading to the error).
   - Use monitoring tools (e.g., **CloudWatch**, **Datadog**, **Sentry**) to alert developers about frequent or critical errors, enabling quicker diagnosis and resolution.

### 5. **Testing and Validation**
   - **User Testing**: Test the error messages with real users to ensure they are clear and helpful. Gather feedback on how easily users can understand and resolve the errors.
   - **Error Injection**: Simulate various error conditions (user errors, system failures, validation issues) in testing environments to verify that the correct error messages are displayed.
   - **A/B Testing**: Perform A/B testing to compare different versions of error messages and track which version leads to quicker user resolution and fewer support requests.
