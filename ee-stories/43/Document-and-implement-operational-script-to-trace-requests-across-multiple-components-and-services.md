# Document and implement operational script to trace requests across multiple components and services
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to document and implement an operational script to trace requests across multiple components and services, **So That** we can track requests end-to-end through the system, helping to diagnose performance bottlenecks, failures, or unexpected behavior.

This story focuses on developing a script that enables tracing requests across different components (e.g., APIs, microservices, databases) in a distributed system. The goal is to provide visibility into how requests propagate through the system, including service-to-service interactions, API calls, and database queries. The script will leverage existing tools like AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry, or custom logging with correlation IDs to track requests.

### Vision
By implementing request tracing, we gain end-to-end visibility into how requests are processed across multiple components and services. This helps in diagnosing issues like latency, service failures, or misconfigurations by providing insights into how each part of the system contributes to request handling. The trace data can also be used for performance optimization and troubleshooting.

### Background
In distributed systems with multiple components and services, it can be challenging to track the flow of a request as it moves through different layers. Tracing helps capture the flow of requests, including timing information and service dependencies, which is essential for understanding and resolving performance bottlenecks and identifying where failures occur. AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry, and custom logging strategies can be used to implement tracing, depending on the system architecture.

### Steps to Implement Request Tracing Across Multiple Components and Services

#### 1. **Choose a Tracing Strategy**

There are several options for tracing requests across components and services. Common choices include:

- **AWS X-Ray**: A managed service for tracing requests in AWS environments. X-Ray integrates with AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, etc.) and supports custom application instrumentation.
- **OpenTelemetry**: An open-source observability framework that provides tracing and metrics collection for distributed systems.
- **Custom Logging with Correlation IDs**: A more manual approach where each request is assigned a unique identifier (correlation ID), which is passed between services and logged for traceability.

For AWS-native environments, **AWS X-Ray** is recommended, but **OpenTelemetry** is a good alternative if you need multi-cloud or custom on-premise setups.

---

#### 2. **Set Up AWS X-Ray for Tracing (AWS- Environments)**

##### Step 1: Enable X-Ray for Supported AWS Services

AWS X-Ray can automatically trace requests for services such as **API Gateway**, **Lambda**, **ECS**, and **RDS**.

- **API Gateway**: Enable X-Ray tracing for API Gateway by configuring your API stage settings in the AWS Management Console.

```bash
aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id <api-id>   --stage-name <stage-name>   --patch-operations op=replace,path=/tracingEnabled,value=true
```

- **Lambda**: Enable X-Ray tracing in the Lambda function settings by setting the `tracingConfig` to `Active`.

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name>   --tracing-config Mode=Active
```

- **ECS**: Add X-Ray as a sidecar container to your ECS tasks to trace requests across containerized services.

```json
{
  'name': 'xray-daemon',
  'image': 'amazon/aws-xray-daemon',
  'essential': true,
  'memory': 128,
  'cpu': 100,
  'portMappings': [
    {
      'containerPort': 2000,
      'hostPort': 2000,
      'protocol': 'udp'
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Step 2: Install the X-Ray SDK in Your Application

For services where you need to manually instrument the code, install the X-Ray SDK for your programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java) and add tracing to your application.

- **Node.js** Example:

```bash
npm install aws-xray-sdk
```

Instrument your application:

```javascript
const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Instrument the entire Express app
app.use(AWSXRay.express.openSegment('MyApp'));

// Define routes
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.send('Hello from Traced App');
});

// Close X-Ray segment
app.use(AWSXRay.express.closeSegment());

app.listen(3000, function() {
    console.log('App listening on port 3000');
});
```

##### Step 3: Visualize Traces in AWS X-Ray Console

Once X-Ray is enabled and the SDK is integrated into your services, trace data will be sent to the AWS X-Ray service. You can visualize traces in the **AWS X-Ray Console**, where you can see:

- **Service Map**: A graphical representation of how requests flow through different services.
- **Individual Traces**: Detailed information about each request, including latency, errors, and which services were called.

---

#### 3. **Set Up OpenTelemetry for Custom or Hybrid Environments**

For non-AWS environments or hybrid environments, **OpenTelemetry** can be used to trace requests across microservices.

##### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry SDK

Install the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. For example, in Node.js:

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node
```

##### Step 2: Instrument Your Application

Initialize OpenTelemetry in your application by configuring the tracer and exporter (to send trace data to a backend like Jaeger, Prometheus, or AWS X-Ray).

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node');
const { SimpleSpanProcessor } = require('@opentelemetry/tracing');
const { ConsoleSpanExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base');

// Initialize OpenTelemetry tracer
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider();
provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter()));
provider.register();

// Use the tracer to create spans for different services/components
const tracer = provider.getTracer('my-tracer');
const span = tracer.startSpan('my-operation');
span.setAttribute('key', 'value');

// Perform some operations
span.end();
```

##### Step 3: Export Traces to a Tracing Backend

Configure your OpenTelemetry SDK to export traces to a backend system, such as **Jaeger** or **Zipkin**, to visualize and analyze the trace data.

Example of setting up Jaeger exporter:

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger
```

Configure the exporter:

```javascript
const { JaegerExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger');

const exporter = new JaegerExporter({
  serviceName: 'my-service',
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:14268/api/traces',
});
```

#### 4. **Implement Custom Logging with Correlation IDs**

In cases where full tracing tools like AWS X-Ray or OpenTelemetry aren’t available, you can implement request tracing using **Correlation IDs** in logs. This method involves adding a unique ID to each request and passing it through every service and component.

##### Step 1: Generate and Pass Correlation IDs

Generate a unique correlation ID when a request enters the system and include it in logs and HTTP headers so that it can be tracked across services.

- **Express.js Example**:

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.correlationId = uuidv4();
  res.setHeader('X-Correlation-ID', req.correlationId);
  next();
});
```

##### Step 2: Log Correlation IDs in Each Service

Ensure that every service or component logs the correlation ID when handling a request. This allows you to trace the request by searching for the correlation ID in the logs.

- **Example Log Entry**:

```json
{
  'timestamp': '2024-09-19T12:34:56Z',
  'correlationId': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  'message': 'Processing request in Service A',
  'level': 'info'
}
```

##### Step 3: Aggregate Logs for End-to-End Tracing

To trace requests across multiple services, aggregate your logs using a centralized logging system like **AWS CloudWatch Logs**, **Elasticsearch (ELK Stack)**, or **Splunk**. You can then search for the correlation ID to follow the request's journey through the system.

- **CloudWatch Logs Search**:

```bash
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name <log-group>   --filter-pattern '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
```

---

#### 5. **Document and Provide Script for Operational Use**

Once the tracing solution is implemented (using AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry, or custom logging), document the following operational steps:

- **How to enable tracing** for specific services (API Gateway, Lambda, ECS, or custom microservices).
- **How to search for traces** in the AWS X-Ray Console, OpenTelemetry backend (e.g., Jaeger), or custom log aggregation system.
- **How to troubleshoot** by analyzing trace data for performance bottlenecks, errors, and service dependencies.

Additionally, create a script that allows the operations team to trace a request across multiple services by searching logs for a correlation ID or viewing the trace in X-Ray/OpenTelemetry.

---

### Example Script for Tracing Requests

Here’s an example of a script that can be used to search for logs with a specific correlation ID in AWS CloudWatch Logs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to trace a request across multiple services using correlation ID

CORRELATION_ID=

if [ -z '' ]; then
  echo 'Usage: create-stories <correlation-id>'
  exit 1
fi

LOG_GROUPS=('ServiceA-LogGroup' 'ServiceB-LogGroup' 'ServiceC-LogGroup')

for LOG_GROUP in '$\{LOG_GROUPS[@]}'; do
  echo 'Searching logs in  for Correlation ID: '
  aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name ''     --filter-pattern ''     --output text
done
```

This script searches for a correlation ID across multiple log groups in AWS CloudWatch.
