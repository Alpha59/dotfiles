# Create an onboarding document and best practices guide for on-call team members
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Manager, **I want** to create an onboarding document and best practices guide for on-call team members, **So That** they can effectively handle incidents, understand responsibilities, and follow standardized procedures to ensure smooth and efficient incident resolution.

This story focuses on developing a comprehensive onboarding guide that introduces new on-call members to their roles and responsibilities, as well as a best practices guide that covers standardized procedures for managing on-call incidents, escalation processes, communication protocols, and post-incident actions.

### Vision
By creating an onboarding document and best practices guide, we ensure that new on-call members have the necessary knowledge and tools to perform their roles effectively. This reduces response times, minimizes errors, and promotes consistency in incident resolution, ultimately leading to improved system reliability and reduced downtime.

### Background
On-call engineers are responsible for monitoring system health, responding to incidents, and ensuring that issues are resolved quickly to minimize impact. However, without proper onboarding and standardized procedures, on-call engineers can experience confusion or delays in addressing incidents. A well-documented onboarding guide, paired with a best practices guide, ensures that all on-call team members have a clear understanding of how to respond to incidents, escalate issues, and communicate with stakeholders.

### Onboarding Document and Best Practices Guide

---

#### 1. **Overview of On-Call Responsibilities**

This section introduces the key responsibilities of an on-call engineer:

- **Monitor System Health**: Regularly check the health of services and applications using monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus).
- **Respond to Alerts**: Be available to respond to alerts within the expected time window.
- **Incident Triage**: Quickly assess the severity of incidents and categorize them (Sev-1, Sev-2, Sev-3, etc.).
- **Issue Resolution**: Investigate the root cause of issues and work to resolve them using established tools and procedures.
- **Escalation**: Know when and how to escalate issues that cannot be resolved at the current level.
- **Post-Incident Actions**: Complete post-incident tasks, including documentation, root cause analysis, and improvement suggestions.

---

#### 2. **Access to Tools and Resources**

Before taking on on-call responsibilities, new team members must have access to the necessary tools and resources.

##### Step 1: Set Up Access

Ensure that on-call members have access to:

- **Monitoring Tools**: Access to tools such as CloudWatch, Datadog, Grafana, etc.
- **On-Call Management Platform**: Ensure access to tools like PagerDuty or OpsGenie for alerting and escalation management.
- **Incident Response Platforms**: Access to Jira, Confluence, or other ticketing and incident tracking systems.
- **Runbooks**: Provide access to all runbooks that document steps for handling common issues and troubleshooting guides.
- **Communication Channels**: Ensure that new on-call members have access to communication platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams for incident updates and collaboration with other teams.

##### Step 2: Test Access

Verify that all new on-call members can access the above systems and tools. Conduct a practice run to ensure they are comfortable with the platforms.

#### 3. **On-Call Schedule and Handover Process**

On-call schedules must be well-organized, with clear handover processes to ensure that the next on-call team member is fully aware of the system's current state.

##### Step 1: Review On-Call Rotation

- On-call members should familiarize themselves with the **on-call rotation** schedule, ensuring they know when their shift begins and ends.
- On-call members should also know how to **swap shifts** with other team members if necessary, following the proper protocol to ensure coverage.

##### Step 2: Handover Process

- At the start of a shift, on-call members should receive a **handover report** from the previous on-call member. This report should include:
  - Outstanding incidents or issues.
  - Any ongoing investigations or actions.
  - Known issues that are under observation.

- Before the end of their shift, the on-call member should prepare a **handover summary** to inform the next on-call team member of:
  - Any unresolved incidents.
  - Any alarms or alerts currently being monitored.
  - Important system health metrics.

- The handover process should also include updating the incident tracker and documenting any key decisions made during the shift.

#### 4. **Incident Response Procedures**

A well-defined incident response procedure is crucial to ensure timely and efficient resolution of issues. The steps outlined here should be followed when responding to any on-call alert.

##### Step 1: Acknowledge the Alert

When an alert is triggered:

- **Acknowledge** the alert in the on-call management system (PagerDuty, OpsGenie) to ensure that other team members know that the incident is being addressed.
- Review the **severity level** of the alert (Sev-1 for critical issues, Sev-2 for major issues, etc.).

##### Step 2: Incident Triage

- **Investigate** the alert using the appropriate monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch logs, Datadog metrics) to understand the scope and impact of the issue.
- Categorize the incident:
  - **Sev-1**: Critical impact, immediate action needed, such as system outages.
  - **Sev-2**: Major impact, but limited to a subset of users or systems.
  - **Sev-3**: Minor issues that require attention but do not severely impact operations.

##### Step 3: Issue Resolution

- Follow the appropriate **runbook** for the specific issue. Runbooks should contain step-by-step instructions for handling common incidents such as:
  - High CPU or memory usage.
  - Database connection failures.
  - Application crash or downtime.
  - Network connectivity issues.

- If there is no runbook for the specific issue, start troubleshooting and document the steps you take to resolve the issue.

##### Step 4: Escalation Protocol

- If you are unable to resolve the issue within the expected time frame, or if the issue requires higher-level access or expertise, **escalate** the incident to the next level of support (e.g., lead engineer or manager).
- Ensure that the escalation follows the predefined **escalation tree**, which specifies who should be contacted and in what order.

---

#### 5. **Communication and Collaboration**

Effective communication during an incident is critical for ensuring everyone is on the same page and for updating stakeholders.

##### Step 1: Communication During an Incident

- Use the designated **incident communication channel** (e.g., a Slack 'war room') to provide regular updates to the team during the incident.
- Ensure that updates are given at regular intervals for critical incidents, even if the issue is still being investigated.

##### Step 2: External Communication

- If the incident impacts customers or users, work with the **communication team** to provide status updates to external stakeholders.
- Ensure that customer-facing communications are reviewed by the appropriate team before being published.

---

#### 6. **Post-Incident Procedures**

After resolving an incident, certain steps should be taken to document the incident and improve future response efforts.

##### Step 1: Post-Incident Documentation

- After an incident, ensure that a **post-incident report** is completed. This report should include:
  - **Summary** of the incident.
  - **Timeline** of events, including when the issue was first detected, when it was acknowledged, and when it was resolved.
  - **Root Cause** of the incident.
  - **Actions Taken** to resolve the issue.
  - **Next Steps** to prevent the incident from occurring again.

##### Step 2: Post-Mortem Meeting

- For significant incidents (e.g., Sev-1 or Sev-2), conduct a **post-mortem meeting** with the on-call team and relevant stakeholders. The goal of this meeting is to:
  - Review the timeline and actions taken.
  - Discuss areas of improvement.
  - Identify additional runbooks, monitoring, or automation that could prevent future issues.

#### 7. **Best Practices for On-Call Engineers**

The best practices guide provides important tips to ensure that on-call members are effective and follow company policies.

##### Best Practice 1: Stay Calm Under Pressure
- Remain calm and methodical when addressing issues, even during high-stress incidents. Take time to review logs and follow the troubleshooting steps without rushing.

##### Best Practice 2: Document Everything
- Always document the steps you take during an incident, including any temporary fixes or workarounds. This information is crucial for post-incident analysis.

##### Best Practice 3: Minimize Impact First
- If a full resolution is not immediately possible, prioritize **minimizing impact** by using failover mechanisms or rolling back recent changes to stabilize the system.

##### Best Practice 4: Use Monitoring Tools Effectively
- Learn to interpret key metrics in your monitoring tools and set up personal **dashboards** for services you are responsible for.

##### Best Practice 5: Collaborate with Team Members
- Donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help from other team members if you are stuck or if you believe the issue requires additional expertise.
