# Define monitoring scenarios and thresholds for response times, error rates, and web vital metrics
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to define monitoring scenarios and thresholds for response times, error rates, and Web Vital metrics, **So That** we can proactively detect and address performance and usability issues, ensuring optimal application performance and a high-quality user experience.

This story focuses on establishing specific monitoring scenarios and thresholds for key performance metrics, including response times, error rates, and Web Vital metrics (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay). By defining these thresholds, we can monitor the application's performance more effectively, identify potential issues early, and maintain service reliability and user satisfaction.

### Vision
Defining monitoring scenarios and thresholds for critical performance metrics enables us to maintain a high level of application performance and user experience. By setting clear thresholds for response times, error rates, and Web Vital metrics, we can detect and respond to performance degradation or usability issues promptly. This proactive approach ensures the application remains reliable and responsive under varying conditions.

### Background
Currently, the lack of defined scenarios and thresholds for monitoring key performance metrics may lead to delayed detection of issues that affect application performance and user experience. Without clear thresholds, it becomes challenging to differentiate between normal variations and potential problems that require attention. Establishing these parameters is essential for effective performance monitoring and incident response.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to define specific monitoring scenarios and thresholds for response times, error rates, and Web Vital metrics. This initiative aims to enhance the monitoring process, enabling early detection of performance issues and maintaining a high standard of application performance and user experience.

## Details
1. **Identify Key Metrics and Monitoring Scenarios**:
    - Identify the critical metrics to monitor, including response times for API endpoints and UI interactions, error rates for system operations, and Web Vital metrics (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Cumulative Layout Shift).
    - Define the scenarios in which these metrics will be monitored, such as during peak traffic periods, after deployments, or under varying network conditions.

2. **Set Thresholds for Response Times**:
    - **API Endpoints**:
        - Average response time should be under 200ms for optimal performance.
        - 95th percentile response time should not exceed 500ms.
    - **UI Interactions**:
        - Page load times should be less than 2 seconds.
        - User interactions such as clicks or form submissions should have a response time of under 1 second.

3. **Define Error Rate Thresholds**:
    - **API Calls**:
        - Total error rate should remain below 1%.
        - 5xx server-side errors should be less than 0.5%.
    - **Application Error Logs**:
        - Monitor the frequency of error log entries, and set a threshold to trigger an alert if errors exceed 5 occurrences per minute.
    - **Client-Side Errors**:
        - JavaScript errors should remain below 1% of total user sessions.

4. **Set Web Vital Metric Thresholds**:
    - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**:
        - Should be less than 2.5 seconds for a good user experience.
    - **First Input Delay (FID)**:
        - Should be less than 100 milliseconds to ensure quick user interaction.
    - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**:
        - Should be less than 0.1 to avoid unexpected layout shifts during page load.
    - **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**:
        - Should be under 800ms for optimal loading performance.

5. **Configure Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - Implement monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Google Analytics) to track the defined metrics and compare them against the established thresholds.
    - Configure alerts to trigger when thresholds are breached, providing immediate notification to the on-call team for investigation and remediation.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
    - Schedule regular reviews of the monitoring scenarios and thresholds to ensure they remain relevant and effective as the application evolves.
    - Adjust thresholds as necessary based on user feedback, changes in usage patterns, or improvements in system performance.

### Testing
- Test the monitoring setup by simulating scenarios where response times, error rates, and Web Vital metrics exceed the defined thresholds to ensure alerts are triggered correctly.
- Validate that the monitoring tools accurately capture and report the performance metrics in real-time, providing actionable insights.
- Review the alerts to confirm they include sufficient context and details for the on-call team to quickly diagnose and address the issues.
- Monitor the system under normal and peak load conditions to verify that the thresholds are appropriately calibrated and do not result in false positives.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Google Analytics) for capturing and analyzing performance metrics.
- Access to the application environment for implementing and testing the monitoring configurations.
- Collaboration with the development and operations teams to define and validate the monitoring scenarios and thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified key metrics and defined monitoring scenarios for response times, error rates, and Web Vital metrics.
- Should have established specific thresholds for each metric to differentiate between normal and abnormal performance.
- Should have configured monitoring tools to track the defined metrics and compare them against the established thresholds.
- Should have set up alerts to notify the on-call team when thresholds are breached, providing immediate feedback on potential issues.
- Should have validated the monitoring and alerting setup through testing to ensure it works as expected and provides actionable insights.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Monitoring Response Times
Given the definition of response time thresholds,
When the response time for an API endpoint exceeds the threshold,
Then an alert should be triggered to notify the on-call team of the potential performance issue.

#### Scenario: Tracking Error Rates
Given the monitoring setup for error rates,
When the error rate for a system operation exceeds the acceptable limit,
Then the monitoring system should detect and alert the team, indicating a potential issue that requires investigation.

#### Scenario: Monitoring Web Vital Metrics
Given the defined thresholds for Web Vital metrics,
When a metric such as Largest Contentful Paint exceeds its threshold,
Then an alert should be generated to indicate a potential degradation in user experience.
