# Design mechanism to recover from permanent failures in system workflows
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to design a mechanism to recover from permanent failures in system workflows, **So That** the system can handle unrecoverable errors gracefully, ensuring that workflows either fail safely, trigger appropriate fallback mechanisms, or provide a path for manual intervention without compromising data integrity or availability.

This story focuses on creating a robust recovery mechanism for workflows that encounter permanent failures (e.g., failed external dependencies, unrecoverable data errors). The mechanism will ensure that workflows either retry safely, invoke alternative recovery strategies, or escalate issues for human intervention, maintaining the reliability and consistency of the system.

### Vision
By designing a comprehensive recovery mechanism for permanent failures, we ensure that the system can handle failure scenarios without causing data loss or prolonged outages. This mechanism allows the system to either self-recover or provide clear paths for remediation, improving fault tolerance and overall system resilience.

### Background
In distributed systems or complex workflows, there are scenarios where components or external dependencies fail irrecoverably. Without a well-defined recovery mechanism, these failures can lead to workflow halts, cascading issues, or even data corruption. A system-level approach is needed to handle these failures and ensure that workflows either safely fail, retry, or move to a fallback path.

## Details

1. **Identify Permanent Failure Scenarios**
   - Work with development and operations teams to identify common permanent failure scenarios in system workflows, such as:
     - **External Dependency Failures**: Unrecoverable failures with third-party APIs, databases, or services.
     - **Data Integrity Issues**: Corrupted or invalid data that prevents workflows from proceeding.
     - **Critical Resource Exhaustion**: Scenarios where key resources (e.g., disk space, memory, rate limits) are exhausted with no immediate solution.
     - **Timeouts and Deadlocks**: Cases where workflows become stuck due to deadlocks or persistent timeouts that cannot be resolved by retries.

2. **Design a Workflow Recovery Strategy**
   - Implement a tiered recovery strategy, including:
     - **Retry Mechanism with Backoff**: For temporary failures that might resolve on their own, implement retries with exponential backoff and jitter to prevent overwhelming resources or dependencies.
     - **Graceful Degradation**: For non-critical workflows, provide alternative or degraded service modes when full functionality is unavailable.
     - **Fallback Actions**: Define fallback actions for workflows that fail irrecoverably (e.g., redirect to a backup service, switch to read-only mode, or skip non-critical steps).
     - **Escalation Path for Manual Intervention**: For critical failures, raise alarms and create tickets for human intervention. Provide detailed error logs and diagnostic data to assist with remediation.

3. **Error Categorization and Handling**
   - Categorize errors into types based on their severity and impact:
     - **Transient Errors**: Errors that are likely temporary and can be resolved with retries.
     - **Permanent Failures**: Errors that require manual intervention or alternative workflows (e.g., failed payments, invalid data).
   - Ensure each category has an appropriate recovery path. Transient errors should have automated retry logic, while permanent failures should trigger fallback or escalation mechanisms.

4. **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ) for Failed Workflow Events**
   - Implement **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs)** for workflows that involve messaging systems (e.g., **AWS SQS**, **Kafka**) to capture events that fail after multiple retry attempts.
   - DLQs allow failed messages or events to be stored for future inspection, ensuring that no data is lost and that operations teams can review and resolve issues without affecting live workflows.
   - Set thresholds for the number of retries before sending events to the DLQ.

5. **Compensation Mechanisms for Data Integrity**
   - Design compensation workflows for scenarios where partial operations succeed before a failure occurs (e.g., compensating a successful payment if the order placement fails).
   - Ensure that these compensation mechanisms reverse or adjust actions to maintain data consistency across the system.
   - Use transactional patterns (e.g., **Sagas**, **Two-Phase Commit**) where appropriate to manage long-running transactions that span multiple services.

6. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all permanent failure scenarios:
     - Use **CloudWatch**, **Prometheus**, or equivalent tools to monitor critical workflows.
     - Trigger alerts when a certain number of retries or permanent failures occur, indicating that human intervention is required.
   - Create dashboard views for operational teams to quickly identify and address failed workflows or DLQ events.

7. **Documentation and Process for Manual Intervention**
   - Document recovery processes for common permanent failures, outlining how to:
     - Inspect and replay failed events from DLQs.
     - Trigger fallback mechanisms or rerun workflows from a safe point.
     - Investigate and resolve critical errors that require manual intervention.
   - Ensure that all recovery processes are well-documented and that teams have clear guidelines for responding to alerts and issues.

### Testing
- Simulate permanent failure scenarios by introducing unrecoverable errors in non-production environments.
- Test retry mechanisms to ensure they follow exponential backoff and eventually route failed workflows to DLQs or fallback paths.
- Validate that alerts are triggered when manual intervention is required and that the system provides sufficient diagnostic information for troubleshooting.
- Test compensation mechanisms to ensure that they properly reverse partial operations when workflows fail midway.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified common permanent failure scenarios and documented appropriate recovery strategies for each.
- Should have implemented retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and DLQs for relevant workflows.
- Should have monitoring and alerting in place to detect workflow failures and escalate issues when necessary.
- Should have tested and validated that the system can gracefully handle permanent failures without compromising data integrity or availability.
- Should have provided documentation for manual intervention and recovery processes.
