# Test Deployment to Beta for CDK Amplify Package
*Repeated for each of the 4 applications*

### **Summary**:

**As an** operational user, **I want** deployment tested in the Beta environment **so that** I know successful deployment at a lower level works.

**As a** developer, **I want** to test the deployment of the CDK Amplify package and the associated React application to the Beta environment **so that** I know the deployment works in a lower level environment.

This includes ensuring that the infrastructure deploys correctly, thoroughly testing the application's end-to-end functionality, addressing any bugs, and making refinements as needed.

### **Background:**

We have successfully created a CDK (Cloud Development Kit) Amplify package that is intended to consume an existing React application. This story outlines the steps to test the deployment of the full structure that has been built.

### **Description:**

The CDK Amplify package has been created, and now we need to validate that the entire infrastructure works as expected when deployed.

* **Step 1: Prerequisites**
    * Ensure that you have set up and configured the AWS CDK environment and Amplify for your project.
* **Step 2: Deploy CDK Stack to your Personal Account and validate**
    * Use the AWS CDK to deploy the Amplify package, which includes the necessary infrastructure components like AWS Amplify,  S3,  Cognito, and more.
    * cdk deploy YourAmplifyStack
    * Monitor the deployment process and address any errors or issues that may arise.
* **Step 4: Deploy the React Application to Beta**
* **Step 5: Test End-to-End Functionality**
    * Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure that all components are working as expected.
    * This includes testing features that rely on the CDK-created infrastructure, such as authentication, storage, and API interactions.
    * Verify that user authentication and authorization work correctly, and users can access the protected resources.
    * Test the integration with  S3, AWS AppSync, or other AWS services included in the infrastructure.
    * Perform end-to-end testing of any serverless functions or Lambda functions if they are part of your application.
* **Step 6: Bug Fixes and Refinement**
    * Address and fix any bugs or issues that are discovered during testing. This may involve making adjustments to your React application code, Amplify configuration, or CDK infrastructure.
    * This may also include creating Backlog tickets or stories to address existing bugs

### **Acceptance Criteria**:

* **Should have**: A CDK Amplify package successfully deployed in the Beta environment.
* **Should have**: The React application correctly deployed and integrated with the CDK infrastructure.
* **Should have**: Comprehensive testing of end-to-end functionality, including authentication, AWS service integration, and serverless functions.
* **Should have**: Resolution of any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
* **Should have**: A refined and well-functioning application ready for further stages of development and deployment.
