# Implement a mechanism to detect downstream dependency overload and avoid retries in those cases
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to implement a mechanism to detect downstream dependency overload and avoid retries in those cases, **So That** we can prevent further strain on overloaded systems, avoid cascading failures, and ensure that upstream systems handle dependency issues gracefully.

This story focuses on creating a mechanism to detect when downstream services or dependencies (such as databases, APIs, or microservices) are overloaded or under stress and avoiding retries when the system is already saturated. This mechanism will help upstream services recognize and respect the degraded state of downstream systems, preventing additional load and improving overall system resilience.

### Vision
By implementing a mechanism to detect downstream dependency overload and prevent retries, we reduce the likelihood of exacerbating existing issues caused by overloaded systems. This also ensures that retry logic is applied intelligently, avoiding retries in scenarios where they would only increase system strain and lead to further degradation or failures.

### Background
When downstream dependencies become overloaded or unresponsive, traditional retry mechanisms may unintentionally increase the load on those systems. This leads to cascading failures, degraded performance, and potential system outages. To avoid this, upstream services need to detect when a dependency is in an overloaded state and avoid sending additional retries during that period. Implementing circuit breakers, load-shedding techniques, and smart retry mechanisms can mitigate these risks.

### Steps to Implement Mechanism to Detect Dependency Overload and Avoid Retries

#### 1. **Define Downstream Dependency Overload Criteria**

Before implementing the mechanism, define what constitutes an 'overloaded' state for each downstream dependency. Common overload indicators include:

- **High Latency**: When response times from the downstream service exceed a certain threshold.
- **Error Rates**: When the number of 4xx/5xx errors from a service increases significantly.
- **Throttling**: When the downstream service begins rejecting requests due to rate limiting or capacity constraints.
- **Resource Saturation**: When downstream services report high CPU, memory, or other resource utilization, indicating they are near capacity.

These metrics should be tracked and monitored in real-time to detect when a downstream service is overloaded.

---

#### 2. **Set Up Monitoring and Alerts for Dependency Overload**

Use monitoring tools like **AWS CloudWatch**, **Datadog**, **Prometheus**, or **New Relic** to track dependency health and detect overload conditions. The following steps will outline how to configure alarms based on overload indicators.

##### Step 1: Monitor Downstream Latency

For each dependency, configure monitoring to track the latency of requests. Use CloudWatch or Datadog to create alarms when latency exceeds the acceptable threshold.

**Example CloudWatch Alarm for API Latency:**

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'HighLatencyAlarm'   --metric-name Latency --namespace AWS/ApiGateway   --statistic Average --period 60 --threshold 5000   --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --evaluation-periods 3   --alarm-actions <SNS-Topic-ARN>   --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=<api-name>
```

This sets an alarm to trigger if latency exceeds 5 seconds for more than three consecutive minutes.

##### Step 2: Monitor Error Rates

Track error rates (4xx/5xx) from downstream services. Set alarms to trigger when error rates rise above a certain percentage of total requests.

**Example CloudWatch Alarm for API Error Rates:**

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'HighErrorRateAlarm'   --metric-name 5xxErrorRate --namespace AWS/ApiGateway   --statistic Sum --period 60 --threshold 10   --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --evaluation-periods 2   --alarm-actions <SNS-Topic-ARN>   --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=<api-name>
```

This triggers when there are more than 10 `5xx` errors in a 1-minute window.

##### Step 3: Monitor Throttling and Resource Utilization

For services like databases, monitor throttling events or resource saturation (CPU, memory, etc.). Use metrics like **ThrottledRequests** for DynamoDB or **CPUUtilization** for EC2 instances.

---

#### 3. **Implement Circuit Breakers**

To prevent retries when downstream services are overloaded, implement **circuit breakers**. A circuit breaker allows upstream services to detect when a downstream service is unhealthy or overloaded and stop sending requests temporarily until the service recovers.

##### Step 1: Choose a Circuit Breaker Library

Select a circuit breaker library that works for your programming language. Common libraries include:

- **Resilience4j** for Java.
- **Opossum** for Node.js.
- **Polly** for .NET.
- **Hystrix** for legacy Java applications.

##### Step 2: Configure the Circuit Breaker

Hereâ€™s an example of configuring a circuit breaker in **Node.js** using the **Opossum** library:

```javascript
const CircuitBreaker = require('opossum');

// Define a function that calls the downstream service
async function callDownstreamService() {
  return await axios.get('https://api.downstream-service.com/resource');
}

// Define the circuit breaker options
const options = {
  timeout: 5000, // Time to wait before considering the request failed
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50, // Break the circuit if 50% of requests fail
  resetTimeout: 30000 // Time to wait before attempting a request again
};

// Create a circuit breaker
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(callDownstreamService, options);

// Fallback function when the circuit is open (i.e., when the downstream service is overloaded)
breaker.fallback(() => {
  console.log('Downstream service is overloaded, skipping retries.');
});

// Call the circuit breaker
breaker.fire()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(err => console.error('Request failed:', err));
```

In this example, if 50% of the requests fail, the circuit breaker 'opens,' and no further requests are sent to the downstream service for 30 seconds. A fallback function is called instead of retrying the request.

---

#### 4. **Implement Retry Logic with Backoff and Load Shedding**

For scenarios where retries are still necessary but need to be throttled, implement **exponential backoff** and **load shedding** techniques to control how often retries occur during overload conditions.

##### Step 1: Exponential Backoff for Retries

Instead of immediately retrying a failed request, use an exponential backoff strategy to increase the wait time between retries.

**Example Exponential Backoff in Node.js:**

```javascript
async function retryWithBackoff(fn, retries = 3, delay = 1000) {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
      console.log(`Retrying in $\{delay} ms...`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      delay *= 2; // Exponential backoff
    }
  }
}
```

This function retries the operation with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s, etc.).

##### Step 2: Load Shedding

In cases where retries would exacerbate the load, implement load shedding to prioritize essential traffic or drop low-priority requests.

Example: Use a **token bucket** algorithm to limit the rate of retries and prevent overload.

---

#### 5. **Handle Graceful Degradation with Fallback Mechanisms**

When downstream services are overloaded, implement **graceful degradation** by providing fallback responses or cached data to ensure that the user experience is not completely disrupted.

##### Step 1: Implement Fallback Responses

In scenarios where the circuit breaker opens or the downstream service is overloaded, provide a fallback response, such as cached data or a default response.

```javascript
breaker.fallback(() => {
  return { message: 'Service temporarily unavailable, please try again later.' };
});
```

This ensures that the upstream service can still respond to users even when the downstream service is unavailable.

##### Step 2: Use Cached Data

If the downstream service provides frequently accessed data, cache the data and serve it when the service is overloaded.

Example using **Redis** for caching responses:

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

async function getCachedDataOrFetch() {
  const cachedData = await client.get('cached-data-key');
  if (cachedData) {
    return JSON.parse(cachedData);
  } else {
    const freshData = await callDownstreamService();
    await client.set('cached-data-key', JSON.stringify(freshData), 'EX', 3600); // Cache for 1 hour
    return freshData;
  }
}
```

#### 6. **Testing and Validation**

Once implemented, test the mechanism to detect overload and avoid retries. Simulate downstream service overload scenarios by introducing latency, increasing error rates, or throttling requests, and verify that:

- Circuit breakers are triggered and prevent retries.
- Exponential backoff works as expected and retries are spaced out.
- Graceful degradation or fallback mechanisms provide appropriate responses to users.
- Monitoring and alarms detect overload conditions.

---

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have implemented monitoring and alarms for downstream dependencies to detect overload conditions (e.g., high latency, error rates, throttling).
- Should have circuit breakers in place for key downstream dependencies to prevent retries when the service is overloaded.
- Should have implemented exponential backoff for retries and load-shedding mechanisms to avoid increasing the load on overloaded systems.
- Should have fallback mechanisms in place to ensure graceful degradation during overload conditions.
- Should have tested and validated the mechanism under simulated overload scenarios to ensure it prevents retries and manages dependency issues effectively.
