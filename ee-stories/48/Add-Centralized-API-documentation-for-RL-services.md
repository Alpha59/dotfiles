# Add Centralized API documentation for RL services
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add centralized API documentation for Reverse Logistics (RL) services, **So That** all relevant teams have a single source of truth for the APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, and usage guidelines.

This story focuses on creating and maintaining centralized API documentation that provides clear, consistent, and accessible information for all RL services. This documentation should be available to developers, testers, and other stakeholders who need to interact with these services during development, testing, or production operations.

### Vision
By implementing centralized API documentation for RL services, we ensure that all teams working with these services have a clear understanding of how to use them, what to expect in terms of functionality, and how to troubleshoot issues. This improves development speed, reduces errors, and ensures better communication across teams. The documentation should be kept up-to-date and accessible through a centralized location, such as a Confluence page, SwaggerHub, or a similar platform.

### Background
API documentation is critical for teams to integrate services, test functionalities, and debug issues. Inconsistent or incomplete API documentation can lead to confusion, miscommunication, and delayed development. Having a single, centralized location where all RL API details are documented ensures that teams can quickly find the information they need without having to search through multiple, disconnected sources.

### Steps to Add Centralized API Documentation for RL Services

#### 1. **Identify APIs and Collect Documentation Details**

The first step is to identify all RL services that require documentation. This may include both internal and external APIs used for reverse logistics operations, such as:

- **Customer  API**: Handles product return requests.
- **Refurbishment API**: Manages refurbishing of returned products.
- **Inventory Management API**: Tracks returned items in inventory.
- **Grading and Testing API**: Manages the testing and grading process for returned items.
- **Audit and Compliance API**: Tracks auditing and compliance checks for returns.
- **Integration APIs**: Services that integrate with external systems (e.g., third-party logistics providers).

For each API, collect the following information:
- **API Name and Description**: A brief explanation of the service and its purpose.
- **Base URL and Environment**: API base URL for different environments (e.g., dev, beta, gamma, production).
- **Endpoints**: List all endpoints available in the API (e.g., `GET /returns`, `POST /returns`, `PUT /returns/{id}`).
- **Request/Response Formats**: Define the request format (JSON, XML, etc.), required/optional parameters, and the expected response format.
- **Authentication**: Document the authentication method used (OAuth, API keys, IAM roles, etc.).
- **Error Codes**: Provide a list of potential error codes and their meanings.
- **Rate Limits**: Specify any rate-limiting policies for the API.
- **Versioning**: Define the current version of the API and any versioning policies.
- **Deprecation Policies**: Outline how old versions of the API are deprecated and provide guidance on how to upgrade to new versions.

#### 2. **Select a Platform for API Documentation**

Choose a platform where the centralized API documentation will be hosted. Common platforms for API documentation include:

- **Swagger (OpenAPI Specification)**: Swagger allows you to document APIs using the OpenAPI specification. You can host Swagger documentation using tools like **SwaggerHub** or integrate it into your applicationâ€™s CI/CD pipeline.
- **Postman**: Postman provides API documentation features that allow you to share documentation with teams. You can publish a Postman Collection with all RL services and endpoints.
- **Confluence/Jira**: For teams using Confluence or Jira, API documentation can be hosted as a set of pages, with links to each API service and their respective documentation.
- **GitHub/GitLab Pages**: If your team uses version control platforms like GitHub or GitLab, you can host static API documentation (e.g., Swagger JSON) on these platforms and provide versioned API details.

For consistency and ease of use, **Swagger/OpenAPI** is often the preferred method as it provides a standardized way to document APIs, with built-in tools for testing and validation.

---

#### 3. **Create API Documentation Using Swagger (OpenAPI Specification)**

If you choose **Swagger** for your API documentation, create an OpenAPI specification file (YAML or JSON) for each RL service. Below is an example of a Swagger definition for a **Customer  API**:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Customer  API
  description: API for managing customer returns
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://api.beta.company.com/returns
    description: Beta environment
  - url: https://api.prod.company.com/returns
    description: Production environment
paths:
  /returns:
    get:
      summary: Get list of all customer returns
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  : '#/components/schemas/Return'
        '401':
          description: Unauthorized
        '500':
          description: Internal Server Error
  /returns/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Get return details by ID
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Return details
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                : '#/components/schemas/Return'
        '404':
          description: Return not found
components:
  schemas:
    Return:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        status:
          type: string
        items:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              itemId:
                type: string
              quantity:
                type: integer
```

This example provides an overview of the **Customer  API** with a few endpoints and schemas defined.

##### Step 1: Generate API Documentation

Once the Swagger file is created, use tools like **Swagger UI** or **SwaggerHub** to generate interactive documentation that users can access. Swagger UI will display the API endpoints, parameters, and allow users to test API calls directly from the documentation.

##### Step 2: Integrate Swagger with CI/CD

To ensure the API documentation stays up to date, integrate Swagger generation into your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that whenever an API is updated, the documentation is automatically generated and published. You can use tools like **Swagger Codegen** to generate Swagger documentation as part of the build process.

#### 4. **Ensure API Documentation is Searchable and Accessible**

Make sure that the documentation is accessible to all relevant stakeholders, including developers, testers, and external partners if needed. Key considerations:

- **Authentication**: If the API documentation is only for internal use, ensure it is hosted on an internal platform (e.g., a secure Confluence page or a restricted SwaggerHub instance) and requires authentication.
- **Searchable**: Ensure the documentation is easy to search and navigate. Use clear naming conventions for endpoints and organize the documentation by service or function (e.g., ' 'Inventory Management,' 'Grading and Testing').
- **Self-Service**: The documentation should be self-explanatory and provide enough detail so that developers can integrate with or test the API without needing to consult someone from the RL team.

---

#### 5. **Update and Maintain API Documentation**

API documentation should be kept up-to-date as services evolve. Establish a process for maintaining the documentation, including:

- **Version Control**: Use version control (e.g., GitHub) to track changes to API documentation. Each time the API is updated, ensure that the documentation is updated to reflect the new or deprecated functionality.
- **Review Process**: Set up a review process where changes to the API and its documentation must be reviewed and approved by the team. This ensures that changes are properly documented and communicated.
- **Deprecation Notices**: For APIs that are being deprecated, include clear deprecation notices in the documentation and provide migration paths for teams to move to the updated version.

---

#### 6. **Testing and Feedback**

Once the centralized API documentation is available, request feedback from developers and other users to ensure that the documentation is clear, accurate, and easy to use. Implement any suggestions to improve usability and ensure that the documentation supports all users in understanding and interacting with RL services effectively.
