# Enable automatic rollback for incorrect customer impacting deployments to prevent SLA breaches
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to enable automatic rollback for incorrect customer-impacting deployments **So That** we can prevent Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches by reverting to a previous stable version when an issue is detected, minimizing customer disruption and downtime.

This story focuses on configuring automatic rollback mechanisms in the deployment pipeline to ensure that when a deployment results in customer-facing issues (e.g., increased error rates, latency, or service outages), the system automatically reverts to the last known good state. By doing this, we mitigate the risk of SLA breaches, improve system resilience, and enhance customer experience.

### Vision
By enabling automatic rollback for customer-impacting deployments, we ensure that any errors introduced by new code or configuration changes are detected and resolved quickly by reverting to a previous version of the application. This reduces downtime, prevents SLA breaches, and improves overall system reliability.

### Background
Deployments can occasionally introduce bugs or misconfigurations that negatively affect customers, such as causing service outages or increasing latency. By implementing automated rollback mechanisms, we can detect these issues quickly through monitoring tools and revert to a stable version before the customer impact becomes significant. This approach is essential for maintaining high availability and meeting SLA requirements in environments where service interruptions are costly.

### Steps to Enable Automatic Rollback for Customer-Impacting Deployments

#### 1. **Identify Customer-Impacting Metrics**

Before configuring the rollback mechanism, identify the key customer-impacting metrics that will be used to trigger the rollback. These metrics may include:

- **Error Rate**: The number of `4xx` and `5xx` errors (e.g., HTTP errors) occurring in the application.
- **Latency**: The time it takes for an API or service to respond to customer requests. Increased latency may indicate a problem.
- **Availability**: The uptime or availability of key services.
- **Transaction Failures**: Failed transactions or operations (e.g., payments, data submissions) that impact customer experience.
- **SLA Breach Thresholds**: Any breaches in predefined SLA thresholds for performance, response time, or uptime.

These metrics will be monitored during deployments, and any significant deviation will trigger an automatic rollback.

---

#### 2. **Implement CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor Key Metrics**

To detect customer-impacting issues during a deployment, set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to monitor the identified key metrics. When any of these alarms are triggered, the deployment pipeline will initiate a rollback.

##### Step 1: Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Error Rate

Create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor `5xx` errors in your application. If the error rate exceeds a certain threshold during or after a deployment, the rollback will be triggered.

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'High5xxErrorRate'   --metric-name 5xxErrorRate --namespace AWS/ApiGateway   --statistic Sum --period 60 --threshold 5   --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --evaluation-periods 2   --alarm-actions <SNS-Topic-ARN>   --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=<api-name>
```

This alarm is set to trigger if more than 5 errors occur in a 1-minute window.

##### Step 2: Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Latency

To monitor API or service latency, create an alarm that tracks the average response time. If the latency exceeds the acceptable threshold, trigger a rollback.

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'HighLatency'   --metric-name Latency --namespace AWS/ApiGateway   --statistic Average --period 60 --threshold 2000   --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --evaluation-periods 1   --alarm-actions <SNS-Topic-ARN>   --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=<api-name>
```

This alarm is set to trigger if the average response time exceeds 2000ms.

##### Step 3: Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Availability

Monitor the availability of critical services. If the availability drops below the SLA-defined threshold, rollback should be triggered.

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'LowAvailability'   --metric-name Availability --namespace AWS/ApiGateway   --statistic Average --period 60 --threshold 99   --comparison-operator LessThanThreshold --evaluation-periods 1   --alarm-actions <SNS-Topic-ARN>   --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=<api-name>
```

This alarm is triggered if the availability drops below 99%.

#### 3. **Configure Automatic Rollback in the Deployment Pipeline**

For automatic rollbacks, use a deployment tool that supports this feature, such as **AWS CodeDeploy**, **Kubernetes (with Helm)**, or **Jenkins with Blue/Green or Canary Deployments**.

##### Step 1: Use AWS CodeDeploy for Blue/Green or Canary Deployments

AWS **CodeDeploy** allows you to set up Blue/Green or Canary deployments with automatic rollback enabled based on CloudWatch Alarms. Hereâ€™s how to configure it:

- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Traffic is shifted between the old (blue) and new (green) environment. If the deployment fails, traffic is shifted back to the old environment.
- **Canary Deployment**: Only a small percentage of traffic is routed to the new environment initially. If the new deployment passes health checks, more traffic is routed over time.

Example CodeDeploy configuration with automatic rollback enabled:

```json
{
  'applicationName': 'MyApp',
  'deploymentGroupName': 'MyApp-DeploymentGroup',
  'deploymentConfigName': 'CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime',
  'autoRollbackConfiguration': {
    'enabled': true,
    'events': [
      'DEPLOYMENT_FAILURE',
      'DEPLOYMENT_STOP_ON_ALARM'
    ],
    'alarms': [
      {
        'name': 'High5xxErrorRate'
      },
      {
        'name': 'HighLatency'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that the deployment will automatically roll back if the CloudWatch alarms for error rate or latency are triggered.

##### Step 2: Configure Rollback in Kubernetes (with Helm)

For Kubernetes-based deployments, **Helm** can be configured to enable rollbacks. By using Kubernetes health checks or external monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog), Helm can automatically revert to the previous release if the deployment fails.

Example of enabling automatic rollback with Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install my-release my-chart --atomic
```

The `--atomic` flag ensures that if the deployment fails or health checks are not met, the previous version is automatically restored.

#### 4. **Testing and Validating the Rollback Mechanism**

Before rolling out the automatic rollback mechanism to production, test it in staging or beta environments to validate that it works as expected.

##### Step 1: Simulate a Failed Deployment

Deploy a version that intentionally fails (e.g., causes increased error rates or latency) and verify that:

- CloudWatch alarms are triggered as expected.
- The deployment is automatically rolled back to the previous stable version.
- All rollback actions are logged, and notifications are sent to the relevant team.

##### Step 2: Test Rollback with Various Scenarios

Test the rollback process with different scenarios, including:

- **Network or service outages**: Verify that the rollback occurs when external dependencies become unavailable.
- **Latency spikes**: Ensure that deployments causing increased latency trigger a rollback.
- **Transaction failures**: Verify that transaction failure thresholds trigger the rollback.

---

#### 5. **Monitor and Improve Rollback Process**

Once automatic rollback is enabled in production, continuously monitor the effectiveness of the rollback process and improve it based on post-mortem analysis of failed deployments.

##### Step 1: Monitor Rollbacks

Use CloudWatch metrics or third-party tools like **Datadog** or **Prometheus** to monitor rollback events and gather data on:

- The frequency of rollbacks.
- The causes of rollback events (e.g., increased error rates, high latency).
- The time taken to detect issues and trigger a rollback.

##### Step 2: Improve Rollback Process

Based on the data collected, make improvements to:

- **Alarm thresholds**: Adjust thresholds for error rates or latency to reduce unnecessary rollbacks or prevent SLA breaches.
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Implement additional fallback mechanisms (e.g., circuit breakers, cached responses) to improve system resilience and avoid triggering a rollback.
- **Notification processes**: Ensure that stakeholders are immediately notified of rollback events and can investigate the root cause.
