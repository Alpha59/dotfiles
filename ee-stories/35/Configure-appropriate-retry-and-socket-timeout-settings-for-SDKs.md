# Configure appropriate retry and socket timeout settings for SDKs
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to configure appropriate retry and socket timeout settings for SDKs, **So That** we can ensure stable and reliable connections between services, while minimizing the risk of excessive retries, timeouts, and resource exhaustion during network or service disruptions.

This story focuses on configuring optimal retry strategies and socket timeout settings for SDKs used in communication with external services (e.g., AWS SDK, REST APIs, databases). Proper configurations ensure that transient errors are handled gracefully while avoiding unnecessary retries that could degrade system performance.

### Vision
By configuring appropriate retry and socket timeout settings, we ensure that the SDKs handling service-to-service communication respond gracefully to transient failures while preventing excessive retries that could overwhelm the system. This improves system resilience, minimizes downtime, and optimizes resource usage.

### Background
When services communicate with external APIs, databases, or other services via SDKs, network disruptions or service unavailability can lead to errors and failed requests. SDKs typically offer retry mechanisms to handle transient failures, but misconfigured retries or timeouts can lead to excessive delays, throttling, or unnecessary resource consumption. Proper configuration of these settings ensures optimal system performance and stability.

## Details

1. **Identify Critical SDKs and Services**
   - Review the SDKs used in the system that require retry and timeout configurations. Common SDKs include:
     - **AWS SDK** for communication with AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SNS, etc.).
     - **HTTP/REST API Clients** for external APIs.
     - **Database SDKs** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
   - Identify critical services where network issues, service disruptions, or timeouts may frequently occur.

2. **Set Appropriate Retry Strategies**
   - Configure SDK retry mechanisms with an appropriate strategy to handle transient failures:
     - **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: Use this strategy to add increasing delay between retries and reduce the risk of simultaneous retry storms during outages. This helps to prevent overloading the failing service.
     - **Fixed Number of Retries**: Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops that could overwhelm the system. Typically, 3-5 retries is reasonable for most services.
     - **Fail-Fast for Critical Services**: For certain time-sensitive or critical operations, use a fail-fast approach with minimal retries to avoid delaying other operations unnecessarily.
   - For example, configuring AWS SDK retries with exponential backoff and jitter:
     ```javascript
     const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
     AWS.config.update({
       maxRetries: 3,
       retryDelayOptions: { base: 200 }, // base delay in milliseconds
     });
     ```

3. **Configure Socket Timeout Settings**
   - Set socket timeouts to define how long the SDK should wait for a response before considering a request failed:
     - **Connection Timeout**: The time the SDK waits to establish a connection to the external service. A typical value might be 1-2 seconds.
     - **Read Timeout**: The time the SDK waits to receive data once a connection is established. A typical value might be 5-10 seconds, depending on the service.
   - Ensure that timeouts are balanced between handling short service disruptions and preventing unnecessary delays.
   - For example, configuring a socket timeout for AWS SDK in Java:
     ```java
     ClientConfiguration clientConfig = new ClientConfiguration();
     clientConfig.setConnectionTimeout(2000); // 2 seconds
     clientConfig.setSocketTimeout(10000); // 10 seconds
      s3Client = new
     ```

4. **Customizing Retries and Timeouts by Service**
   - Tailor retry and timeout configurations based on the service being called:
     - **Database Services**: For database SDKs, longer read timeouts and fewer retries may be appropriate to account for query execution times.
     - **REST API Services**: For external APIs, shorter timeouts and retry limits can prevent delays caused by non-responsive services.
     - **AWS Services**: AWS SDKs should use defaults provided by AWS, adjusted slightly based on specific use cases, such as handling S3, DynamoDB, or SNS communication.

5. **Monitor and Log Retry Events**
   - Set up logging and monitoring for retries and timeouts:
     - Log each retry attempt, including details such as the number of retries, error codes, and elapsed time before success or failure.
     - Monitor key metrics such as retry rates, success rates after retries, and timeouts using tools like **CloudWatch**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus**.
   - Example: Logging retries in a Node.js AWS SDK application:
     ```javascript
     AWS.config.logger = console; // Logs retry attempts and other SDK events
     ```

6. **Test and Validate Configurations**
   - Simulate transient failures and network timeouts in a staging environment to validate the effectiveness of the retry and timeout configurations:
     - Simulate service disruptions (e.g., shutting down a database or throttling an API) and observe how the SDK responds.
     - Validate that the retry mechanisms follow the exponential backoff strategy and do not lead to unnecessary delays or failed requests.
     - Confirm that timeout settings provide enough time for services to recover but are short enough to prevent blocking other operations.

7. **Adjust Based on Feedback and Service SLAs**
   - Based on test results and real-world feedback, fine-tune the retry and timeout settings to align with service-level agreements (SLAs) and operational needs.
   - For services with stringent SLAs, ensure that timeouts and retries do not lead to excessive latency or failure to meet performance expectations.
   - Review and update retry and timeout settings regularly as the system grows or service dependencies change.

### Testing
- Simulate network latency, timeouts, and transient service failures to test SDK behavior.
- Validate that retries follow exponential backoff with jitter and that requests eventually succeed or fail gracefully.
- Ensure socket timeouts are correctly set and that no excessive delays or premature timeouts occur during normal operations.
- Log and monitor retry attempts and timeout events to confirm that retry logic is functioning as expected.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have appropriate retry strategies configured for each SDK, with exponential backoff and jitter for retries.
- Should have socket timeouts configured for connection and read timeouts to ensure stable communication with external services.
- Should have tested retry and timeout settings by simulating transient failures and network issues, ensuring optimal performance under stress.
- Should have monitoring and logging in place for tracking retry attempts and timeouts.
- Should have validated that the retry and timeout settings align with service SLAs and operational requirements.
