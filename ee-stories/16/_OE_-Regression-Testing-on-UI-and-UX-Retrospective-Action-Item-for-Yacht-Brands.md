# [OE] Regression Testing on UI/UX - Retrospective Action Item for Yacht Brands
### Summary
**AS a** QA Engineer
**I WANT** to perform regression testing on UI/UX
**SO** we can ensure that our user interface maintains its expected functionality and user experience after changes.

### Additional Context
UI/UX regression testing is essential to verify that changes to our applications do not introduce unintended defects or affect the user experience negatively. This story aims to focus on conducting thorough regression testing specifically on the UI/UX aspects of our applications.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Should have** identified the critical UI/UX components and functionalities that require regression testing.
- **Should have** created test cases and scripts specifically targeting UI/UX elements.
- **Should have** run the regression tests to ensure that the UI/UX remains consistent and functional after changes.
- **Should have** documented any defects or anomalies discovered during regression testing.
- **Should have** communicated the results of the regression testing to the development team for resolution.
- **Should have** integrated UI/UX regression testing into our regular testing processes.
- **Should have** scheduled periodic regression testing cycles to ensure ongoing UI/UX stability.
