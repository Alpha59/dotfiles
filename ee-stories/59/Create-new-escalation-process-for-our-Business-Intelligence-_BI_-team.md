# Create new escalation process for our Business Intelligence (BI) team
## Summary
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the Story, at a high level, as well as include any additional resources needed to complete the Story.)

**AS a** member  Tech Team,
**I WANT** to write and present a new escalation process for our Dependent Business Intelligence (BI) team,
**SO** that both teams are aligned on the procedure for escalation, ensuring clarity on when and how different types of data errors should be escalated.

## Additional Context
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the story as well as include any additional resources needed to accomplish the Story.)

Currently, the escalation process for data errors from the BI team to the engineering team is ill-defined and used sporadically. This lack of a clear process can lead to delays in resolving critical issues and inefficiencies in communication between the two teams. By developing a structured escalation process, we aim to streamline communication, prioritize issues effectively, and ensure timely resolution of data errors. The new process should take into account the types of problems that have arisen in the past and define clear criteria for escalation based on the severity and impact of the issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
[//]:# (This is a very explicit list of everything that is required to be completed, in the past tense, to finish the story. Each line starts with 'should have'.)
[//]:# (Refer to https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/ailor/UserStoriesandTickets#HOtherAcceptanceCriteriaformats for more information on Acceptance Criteria formats)

- Should have reviewed existing tickets and identified common types and severities of issues that have arisen in the past between the BI and engineering teams.
- Should have worked closely with the BI team to understand their needs, concerns, and any specific requirements for the escalation process.
- Should have developed a clear definition of what constitutes an escalation, including categorizing different types of issues based on severity, impact, and urgency.
- Should have created a detailed escalation procedure that includes steps for the BI team to follow when escalating an issue, guidelines for how the engineering team will respond, and expected timelines for resolution.
- Should have developed criteria for prioritizing escalated issues to ensure that critical problems are addressed promptly.
- Should have included a feedback mechanism in the escalation process to allow for continuous improvement of the procedure based on real-world use.
- Should have presented the new escalation process to both the BI and engineering teams, ensuring that all stakeholders understand the process and their roles within it.
- Should have created documentation for the escalation process, making it easily accessible to both teams for future reference.
