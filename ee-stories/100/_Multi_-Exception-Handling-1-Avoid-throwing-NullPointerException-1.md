# [Multi] Exception Handling 1 - Avoid throwing NullPointerException: 1
## Summary:
As a developer I want my exceptions to be handled, not swallowed so that I am aware of exceptions and can retrieve a stack trace when one happens.

## Motivation:
A COE Led to us having a complete re-evaluation of our exception handling. This is the first set of stories to address exception cases in our system. This will lower on-call burden, and avoid issues which cause COEs.

## Acceptance Criteria:
This story is completed when:

Given that we are calling a method which throws a checked exception
When we receive a checked exception from that method call
Then, we should handle that checked exception.

Then, we should Log the appropriate exception message through our logger

Then, we should return a checked exception from our system (if appropriate)

## Details:

We should first address the small number of universal exception issues which are present in our logic. These are limited to cases where exceptions are being mishandled, or swallowed with no intention.

Avoid throwing null pointer exceptions.


Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other illegal uses of the null object. NullPointerException objects may be constructed by the virtual machine. Normally a higher level abstraction is more appropriate - so that developers know what shouldnâ€™t be null. NPEs are assumed to be created by the VM at runtime.

```
//
if (highThreshold == null && lowThreshold == null) {
    throw new NullPointerException(
        'Either high threshold or low threshold is required');
}
// Should be
if (highThreshold == null && lowThreshold == null) {
    throw new InvalidInputException( // or something
        'Either high threshold or low threshold is required');
}
```


## Testing
Testing will require updating unit tests, and testing through regression testing through Coral Explorer for each service. Verify that upstream references are not impacted functionally.
