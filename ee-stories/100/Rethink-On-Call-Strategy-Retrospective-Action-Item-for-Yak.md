# Rethink On-Call Strategy - Retrospective Action Item for Yak
### Summary
**AS an** On-call Engineer
**I WANT** to rethink our on-call strategy
**SO** we can align it with our sprint cycles and optimize response times.

### Additional Context
Our current on-call rotation may not align effectively with our sprint cycles, leading to inefficiencies or delayed responses. This story focuses on rethinking our on-call strategy to better align with our sprint cycles and improve incident response times. This is especially important with a Globalized team across 4 time zones, where the On-call may now be split between 'wake-time' zones.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Should have** reviewed our current on-call rotation and response processes.
- **Should have** identified areas for improvement based on sprint cycles and team availability.
- **Should have** proposed a revised on-call strategy that aligns with sprint cycles and workload.
- **Should have** discussed and validated the proposed changes with the team and stakeholders.
- **Should have** updated the on-call rotation schedule to reflect the revised strategy.
- **Should have** communicated the changes to the team and provided guidance on the new on-call process.
- **Should have** monitored the impact of the revised on-call strategy on incident response times.
- **Should have** collected feedback from team members and stakeholders on the new on-call process.
- **Should have** made adjustments to the on-call strategy based on feedback and results.
- **Should have** documented the revised on-call strategy and process for future reference.

Need better strategy for on-call. Tuesday to Tuesday no longer makes sense. We have sprints from Monday to Monday. Need to rethink this
