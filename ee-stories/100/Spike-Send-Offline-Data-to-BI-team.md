**SO** that I do not have to read the quip file

## Acceptance Criteria
[//]:# (This is a very explicit list of everything that is required to be completed, in the past tense, to finish the Spike. Each line starts with 'Should have'.)

## Findings
*Findings are added below as comments*
[//]:# (This is a write up of what was learned from the Spike and should answer all of the questions in the acceptance criteria.)
