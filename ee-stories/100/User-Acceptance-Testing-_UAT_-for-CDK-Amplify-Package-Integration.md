# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for CDK Amplify Package Integration
*Repeated for each of the 4 applications*

### **Summary:**

**As an** operational user, **I want** to perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the application to **so that** I can ensure the application meets desired requirements and expectations.

**As a** user, **I want** to perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the new CDK Amplify package's integration with an existing React Application so that the application meets the desired requirements and expectations.

### **Background:**

A new CDK Amplify package has been created to integrate with an existing React Application. This story outlines the steps for performing User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure that the integration meets the desired requirements and expectations.

### **Description:**

As part of the UAT process, we will test the new CDK Amplify package's integration with the existing React Application. This testing aims to confirm that the application functions as expected and that the integration aligns with the defined specifications.

* **Step 1: Prerequisites**
    * Ensure that the CDK Amplify package and React Application are ready for testing.
    * Access the testing environment where the integration will be tested.
    * Verify that the application loads successfully without errors or issues.
* **Step 3: Functional Testing**
    * Test all existing functionalities of the application to ensure they work as expected
    * Confirm that the CDK Amplify package components (e.g., authentication, data storage, APIs) are accessible and function correctly.
* **Step 4: User Authentication and Authorization**
    * Verify that the user authentication and authorization processes are working as intended. Test both authenticated and unauthenticated user scenarios.
    * Ensure that authorized users can access protected resources while unauthorized users are appropriately restricted.
* **Step 5: Data Storage and Retrieval**
    * Test data storage and retrieval features, especially those that rely on the CDK-created infrastructure, such as  S3 or a database.
    * Confirm that data is being stored and retrieved correctly.
* **Step 6: API Interactions**
    * Test API interactions, including requests and responses.
    * Check that data is correctly exchanged between the React Application and the APIs deployed via the CDK Amplify package.
* **Step 7: Error Handling**
    * Trigger and test error scenarios to confirm that the application handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error messages or feedback.
* **Step 8: Performance Testing**
    * Conduct performance testing to evaluate how the integration handles load and identify areas for optimization.
* **Step 9: Compatibility Testing**
    * Test the application across different browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
* **Step 10: Set-up time to review the UAT plan with Users**
* **Step 11: Bug Reporting**
* **Step 12: Feedback and Approval**
    * Gather feedback from relevant stakeholders and users involved in the UAT process.
    * This may need to use an MCM

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Should have:** Successful testing of all existing application functionalities.
* **Should have:** Verification of user authentication and authorization processes.
* **Should have:** Successful testing of data storage and retrieval features.
* **Should have:** Successful testing of API interactions.
* **Should have:** Successful testing of error handling.
* **Should have:** Performance testing results and potential areas for optimization.
* **Should have:** Confirmation of cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
* **Should have:** User and stakeholder feedback documented and considered.
* **Should have:** Approval from relevant stakeholders for the integration.
