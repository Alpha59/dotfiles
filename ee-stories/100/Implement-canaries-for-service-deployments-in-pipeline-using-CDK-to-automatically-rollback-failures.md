# Implement canaries for service deployments in pipeline using CDK to automatically rollback failures
### Summary
**As an** Engineer, **I want** to implement canaries for service deployments in the pipeline using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to automatically rollback failures, **So That** we can detect issues early during deployments, ensure smooth rollouts, and automatically revert to a stable state if failures are detected.

This story focuses on integrating canary deployments into the CI/CD pipeline using AWS CDK. By deploying changes to a small subset of instances or users first and monitoring for potential issues, we aim to identify and mitigate problems before they impact the entire user base. An automatic rollback mechanism will ensure that the deployment is reverted if the canary fails.

### Vision
Canary deployments provide a safe and controlled way to roll out new changes, reducing the risk of widespread issues by gradually exposing the changes to a small portion of the environment. By using CDK to implement this mechanism in the pipeline, we ensure that any detected issues trigger an automatic rollback, thereby maintaining system stability and minimizing customer impact.

### Background
Currently, deployments may go directly to all users or instances, increasing the risk of introducing defects that can cause system-wide outages or performance degradation. Implementing canary deployments within the CDK pipeline allows for more cautious rollouts, where changes are first tested on a small scale. This helps in early detection of issues and provides an automated rollback path in case of failures.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement canary deployments in the CDK pipeline, enabling automatic rollback in case of deployment failures. This initiative supports the goal of safer and more reliable deployments, minimizing the risk of customer impact due to failed changes.

## Details
1. **Define Canary Deployment Strategy**:
    - Determine the criteria for canary deployments, such as the percentage of traffic or instances that will receive the new deployment first.
    - Establish success metrics for the canary, including error rates, response times, and other key performance indicators that will be monitored.

2. **Implement Canary Deployment in CDK**:
    - Use AWS CDK to define and configure the canary deployment process in the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Integrate with services like AWS CodeDeploy or AWS Lambda for automated canary deployments, allowing the new changes to be deployed to a subset of instances or users.
    - Include logic for gradually increasing the scope of the deployment if the canary is successful.

3. **Configure Monitoring and Automatic Rollback**:
    - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch) to track the defined success metrics during the canary deployment.
    - Implement automatic rollback logic that triggers if the metrics indicate a failure, reverting the deployment to the last known stable state.

4. **Test Canary Deployment and Rollback Mechanism**:
    - Develop test scenarios to simulate various deployment outcomes, including both successful canary releases and failures.
    - Validate that the pipeline correctly deploys the canary, monitors the success metrics, and initiates an automatic rollback if necessary.

5. **Documentation and Training**:
    - Document the canary deployment process, including how to define success metrics, monitor deployments, and interpret rollback events.
    - Provide training for the development and operations teams on how to use the new canary deployment feature within the CDK pipeline.

### Testing
- Conduct tests to validate the canary deployment process, ensuring that changes are deployed to a subset of instances or users and monitored for potential issues.
- Simulate failure scenarios during canary deployments to ensure that the automatic rollback mechanism triggers correctly and reverts to the stable state.
- Test the gradual rollout logic to confirm that successful canary deployments are scaled up incrementally without introducing issues.
- Monitor logs and metrics to verify that the system behaves as expected during both successful and failed canary deployments.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with AWS services such as CodeDeploy, Lambda, and CloudWatch for deploying, monitoring, and managing canary deployments.
- Access to the CDK pipeline configuration for implementing and testing the canary deployment mechanism.
- Collaboration with the development and operations teams to define success metrics and validate the deployment process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have implemented canary deployment logic in the CDK pipeline, allowing changes to be deployed to a subset of instances or users.
- Should have configured monitoring for success metrics to detect potential issues during the canary phase.
- Should have implemented an automatic rollback mechanism that triggers in case of canary deployment failures.
- Should have validated the canary deployment and rollback process through testing, ensuring that it functions correctly and reliably.
- Should have documented the canary deployment process and provided training for the team on how to use this feature within the CDK pipeline.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Canary Deployment with Automatic Rollback
Given the implementation of canary deployment in the CDK pipeline,
When a new change is deployed to a subset of instances or users,
Then the deployment should be monitored for success metrics, and an automatic rollback should trigger if the metrics indicate a failure.

#### Scenario: Gradual Rollout After Successful Canary
Given a successful canary deployment,
When the success metrics meet the defined thresholds,
Then the deployment should gradually increase its scope, rolling out to additional instances or users.

#### Scenario: Testing the Canary Deployment and Rollback
Given the need to validate the canary deployment process,
When test scenarios are executed,
Then the pipeline should correctly deploy the canary, monitor success metrics, and initiate an automatic rollback in case of failure.
