# Configure Sev-2 alarms to capture failures within 5 minutes of customer impact
### Summary
**As a** Reliable Engineer, **I want** to configure Severity 2 (Sev-2) alarms to capture failures within 5 minutes of customer impact, **So That** we can respond to critical issues promptly, minimizing downtime and mitigating the impact on customers.

This story focuses on setting up a robust monitoring and alerting system to detect Sev-2 level failures quickly. By configuring these alarms to trigger within a short time frame, we aim to ensure that critical issues affecting customers are identified and addressed with minimal delay.

### Vision
Configuring Sev-2 alarms to capture failures within a 5-minute window will enhance our ability to respond to incidents that significantly impact customer experience but do not constitute a full service outage. This proactive approach will allow the team to identify and mitigate issues rapidly, maintaining a high level of service reliability and customer satisfaction. Timely detection of such issues is crucial for reducing the potential negative impact on users.

### Background
Currently, there is a need to improve the response time to Sev-2 incidents, which can affect user experience and operational performance if not addressed promptly. Delays in detecting and responding to these incidents can result in extended downtime, degraded performance, and customer dissatisfaction. Configuring precise and timely alarms for Sev-2 failures is essential for improving incident response and maintaining service quality.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to configure monitoring tools and alerts to detect Sev-2 incidents within a 5-minute window of occurrence. This initiative will enable faster detection and response to critical issues, reducing their impact on customers and enhancing the overall reliability of our services.

## Details
1. **Define Sev-2 Criteria**:
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to define what constitutes a Sev-2 incident, focusing on failures that significantly impact customer experience but are not complete outages.
    - Identify key metrics and thresholds that indicate a Sev-2 failure, such as increased error rates, response time degradation, and partial service unavailability.

2. **Configure Monitoring and Alarms**:
    - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to track the defined Sev-2 criteria, ensuring real-time data collection and analysis.
    - Configure alarms to trigger when metrics breach the established thresholds, ensuring that alarms are sensitive enough to detect issues within 5 minutes of customer impact.

3. **Establish Alarm Logic**:
    - Implement logic for alarms to avoid false positives, such as using sliding windows and aggregating data over short time intervals to confirm consistent patterns before triggering an alert.
    - Include context in alarm notifications, such as affected services, error codes, and possible causes, to facilitate quick diagnosis.

4. **Integrate with Incident Response**:
    - Integrate Sev-2 alarms with incident response tools and processes, such as PagerDuty or Opsgenie, to ensure immediate notification of the on-call team.
    - Define escalation paths and protocols for Sev-2 incidents to ensure that alerts are addressed promptly.

5. **Test and Optimize Alarms**:
    - Conduct testing to simulate Sev-2 scenarios and validate that alarms trigger within the expected 5-minute window.
    - Review and fine-tune alarm thresholds and logic based on test results and feedback to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

### Testing
- Perform simulated Sev-2 incident tests to validate that alarms trigger within 5 minutes and provide accurate notifications.
- Test alarm integration with incident response tools to ensure proper routing and escalation of alerts to the on-call team.
- Monitor the system behavior and alarm performance during testing to identify any necessary adjustments to thresholds or logic.
- Conduct a post-implementation review with stakeholders to ensure that alarms are functioning as intended and effectively capturing Sev-2 incidents.

### External Dependencies
- Access to monitoring tools and systems for configuration and data collection.
- Collaboration with stakeholders to define Sev-2 criteria and incident response protocols.
- Integration with incident response tools for alert routing and escalation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have defined and documented criteria for what constitutes a Sev-2 incident and the corresponding metrics to monitor.
- Should have configured alarms to detect Sev-2 failures and trigger within 5 minutes of customer impact.
- Should have integrated alarms with incident response tools to ensure immediate notification and escalation of Sev-2 incidents.
- Should have validated the effectiveness of alarms through testing and optimized thresholds to minimize false positives.
- Should have established a process for regular review and adjustment of Sev-2 alarms to maintain their effectiveness.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Detecting Sev-2 Failures
Given the defined criteria for Sev-2 incidents,
When a failure that meets these criteria occurs,
Then the alarm should trigger within 5 minutes, providing a detailed notification to the on-call team.

#### Scenario: Alarm Integration with Incident Response
Given the integration of Sev-2 alarms with incident response tools,
When an alarm is triggered,
Then the on-call team should receive an immediate notification for prompt action.

#### Scenario: Testing and Optimization of Sev-2 Alarms
Given the need to ensure alarm accuracy,
When testing scenarios are conducted,
Then the alarms should be fine-tuned to reduce false positives and ensure prompt detection of actual incidents.
