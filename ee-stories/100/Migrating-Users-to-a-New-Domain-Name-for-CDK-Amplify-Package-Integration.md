# Migrating Users to a New Domain Name for CDK Amplify Package Integration
*Repeated for each of the 4 applications*

### **Summary:**

**As an** operational user, **I want** a smooth user migration to the new portal upon launch, **so that** I have continued feature development and deprecation of the old portal.

**As a** developer, **I want** to migrate users to the new portal once it is launched, **so that** I can continue feature development and deprecate the old portal.

### **Background:**

Our project involves migrating users from the existing domain name to a new domain name for a CDK Amplify package that integrates with an existing React Application. This story outlines the steps for performing the migration smoothly and with minimal impact on users.

### **Description:**

The objective is to ensure that the transition to the new domain is seamless for our users while maintaining their data and authentication. This migration is part of a broader effort to rebrand and optimize our application.

* **Step 1: Pre-Migration Planning**
    * Discuss the migration strategy and objectives with the development and operations teams.
    * Decide on a clear timeline for the migration.
* **Step 2: Confirm Set Up the New Domain**
* **Step 3: Notify Users**
    * Inform users about the upcoming migration, the reasons for it, and the expected benefits.
    * Provide users with clear instructions on what to expect and any actions they need to take.
* **Step 4: Implement Redirects**
    * Set up URL redirects from the old domain to the new domain to automatically guide users to the new site.
* **Step 5: Testing and Verification**
    * Conduct thorough testing on a staging or testing environment to verify that all configurations and redirects work as expected.
* **Step 6: Rollout Plan**
    * Define a rollout plan that specifies when the migration will occur and any downtime, if necessary.
* **Step 7: Post-Migration Verification**
    * After the migration, conduct additional tests to ensure that the live environment operates as expected.
* **Step 8: User Communication**
    * Send a notification to users, confirming that the migration is complete and that they can access the application using the new domain.
* **Step 9: Monitoring and Support**
    * Continuously monitor the application to detect and address any issues that may arise during the post-migration period.
    * Provide support to users who encounter problems accessing the application from the new domain.
* **Step 10: Documentation Update**
    * Update all relevant documentation and inform stakeholders about the successful migration.

This migration ensures that users experience minimal disruption and can access the CDK Amplify package integrated with the React Application via the new domain name seamlessly.


### **Acceptance Criteria**

* **Should have:** Confirmation of the new domain setup.
* **Should have:** Notification sent to users.
* **Should have:** Successful URL redirects.
* **Should have:** Successful testing and verification.
* **Should have:** Migration rollout plan.
* **Should have:** Successful post-migration verification.
* **Should have:** Confirmation notification to users.
* **Should have:** Monitoring and support during post-migration.
* **Should have:** Documentation update and stakeholder notification.
