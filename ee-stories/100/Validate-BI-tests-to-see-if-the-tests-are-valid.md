# Validate BI tests to see if the tests are valid
## Summary
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the Story, at a high level, as well as include any additional resources needed to complete the Story.)

**AS a** BI Team member
**I WANT** the tech team to validate my validations by telling them if data should or should not exist
**SO** that I do not need to understand how Pedigree works.

## Additional Context
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the story as well as include any additional resources needed to accomplish the Story.)

The BI Team has created a quip with 300 test cases, claiming that data is not populated; https://quip-amazon.com/aHu1Abbgcq7K/Isley-Offline-Data-Validation

We need to figure out if things are actually missing, or the BI team is FOS.

## Acceptance Criteria
[//]:# (This is a very explicit list of everything that is required to be completed, in the past tense, to finish the story. Each line starts with 'should have'.)
[//]:# (Refer to https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/ailor/UserStoriesandTickets#HOtherAcceptanceCriteriaformats for more information on Acceptance Criteria formats)

- Should have gone through the quip above and determined if there are any missing data elements.
