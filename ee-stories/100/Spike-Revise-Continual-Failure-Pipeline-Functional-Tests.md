# Spike: Revise Continual Failure Pipeline Functional Tests
## Description
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the Spike as well as include any additional resources needed to accomplish the Spike.)

**AS a** OPs Team / FC Customer
**I WANT** the most recent changes flowing through the pipelines quickly
**SO** that I am able to manage/edit/screen devices rapidly and with the latest code

Review each failing pipeline functional test and see what tests are failing. This ticket is not to resolve them, but create tickets for disabling bad tests/removing them, and fixing required tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
[//]:# (This is a very explicit list of everything that is required to be completed, in the past tense, to finish the Spike. Each line starts with 'Should have'.)

- Should have Identified which FTs are continually failing
- Should have documented the tests and their original creation date
- Should have documented the test's last pass date
- Should have documented the test's purpose
- Should have identified each failing test as 'Remove' or 'Fix'
- Should have created tickets grouped by Service for each of the Services with failing functional tests

## Findings
*Findings are added below as comments*
[//]:# (This is a write up of what was learned from the Spike and should answer all of the questions in the acceptance criteria.)
