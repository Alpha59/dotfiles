# Deploy Changes to Beta Stage
*Repeated for each of the 4 applications*


### **Summary:**

**As a** developer, **I want** to deploy the latest changes from the development environment to the Beta stage in the RL environment, **so that** I can verify a deployed version of the application before production.

This story includes tasks such as code review, pipeline configuration verification, testing, deployment to the Beta stage, smoke testing, and validation of the Beta stage configuration.

### **Description:**

We need to deploy the latest changes from the development environment to the Beta stage in the RL environment. Below are the tasks and instructions for accomplishing this deployment.

### **Tasks:**

1. **Code Review:**
    1. Ensure that the code changes in the development environment have been reviewed and approved.
2. **Pipeline Configuration:**
    1. Verify that the deployment pipeline is properly configured to handle deployments to different stages.
3. **Testing:**
    1. Run thorough tests on the code changes in the Beta stage environment to identify any potential issues.
    2. Address and resolve any issues or defects found during testing.
4. **Deployment to Beta:**
    1. Trigger the deployment process to the Beta stage in the RL environment.
    2. Ensure that the changes are deployed to the correct AWS account and region, as defined in the configuration.
5. **Smoke Testing:**
    1. Conduct a quick smoke test in the Beta environment to ensure that the changes are working as expected.
6. **Validation:**
    1. Validate the Beta stage configuration in the format specified below.

### **Configuration:**

```
// Standard landscape of the RL environment outside of isolated accounts
export const STAGES: StageRecord = {
    BETA: {
        name: Stage.BETA,
        account: Account.BETA,
        environments: [
            {
                region: Region.US_WEST_2,
            },
        ],
    },
    PROD: {
        name: Stage.PROD,
        account: Account.PROD,
        environments: [
            {
                region: Region.US_EAST_1,
            },
        ],
    };
};
```

### **Additional Notes:**

* Ensure that the necessary approvals and checks are in place before deploying to the Beta stage.
* If any issues are encountered during testing or deployment, they should be addressed promptly to avoid delays in the deployment process.

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Given** the need to deploy changes to the Beta stage,
    * **when** the code changes in the development environment have been reviewed and approved,
    * **then** merging the code will automatically cause a Beta Stage update. ****
* **Given** the need to deploy changes to the Beta stage,
    * **when** the CDK or Infrastructure change is merged
    * **then** the deployment pipeline should be correctly configured to build the CDK change to BETA
* **Given** that potential issues were identified during testing,
    * **when** addressing and resolving these issues,
    * **then** the identified issues or defects should have been addressed and resolved.
* **Given** the need to deploy to the Beta stage,
    * **when** the deployment process is triggered to the Beta stage in the RL environment,
    * **then** changes should be deployed to the correct AWS account and region as defined in the configuration.
* **Given** the need to deploy changes to the Beta stage,
    * **when** a quick smoke test in the Beta environment is conducted,
    * **then** the changes should be working as expected.



* **Should have:** Necessary approvals and checks in place before deployment to the Beta stage.
* **Should have:** Prompt addressing and resolution of any issues encountered during testing or deployment to avoid delays in the deployment process.
* **Should have:** Identified potential issues during testing.
* **Should have:** Smoke test conducted successfully.
