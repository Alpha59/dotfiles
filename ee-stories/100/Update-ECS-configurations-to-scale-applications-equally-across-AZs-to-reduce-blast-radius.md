# Update ECS configurations to scale applications equally across AZs to reduce blast radius
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to update the  Elastic Container Service (ECS) configurations to scale applications equally across Availability Zones (AZs), **So That** we can reduce the blast radius in case of an AZ failure and ensure high availability and resilience of our applications.

This story focuses on modifying ECS configurations to distribute application instances evenly across multiple AZs within a region. This approach helps in minimizing the impact of an AZ outage by ensuring that a single zone failure does not take down the entire application, thereby maintaining service availability and reducing the potential blast radius.

### Vision
By scaling applications equally across multiple AZs, we can enhance the fault tolerance and availability of our services. This ensures that even in the event of an AZ failure, the application remains operational in other zones, reducing the risk of a total service outage. This configuration promotes high availability and resilience, contributing to a more reliable user experience.

### Background
Currently, ECS may not be configured to distribute application instances evenly across AZs, which can lead to an increased blast radius if an AZ failure occurs. Without proper distribution, a significant portion of the application could be impacted by an AZ outage, leading to degraded performance or service unavailability. Updating ECS configurations to balance instances across AZs is essential for reducing this risk.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to update ECS configurations to scale applications equally across AZs, thereby reducing the blast radius in case of an AZ failure and ensuring consistent service availability and performance.

## Details
1. **Review Current ECS Configuration**:
    - Assess the current ECS service configurations to determine how tasks are being distributed across AZs.
    - Identify any existing configurations that may result in an uneven distribution of tasks, such as placement strategies or constraints.

2. **Update ECS Service and Task Definitions**:
    - Modify the ECS service configuration to use a placement strategy that ensures even distribution of tasks across AZs. Use the `spread` placement strategy on the `attribute:ecs.availability-zone` to distribute tasks equally.
    - Adjust task definitions if necessary to ensure that tasks are compatible with deployment across multiple AZs, including considerations for networking and storage.

3. **Configure Load Balancer**:
    - Ensure that the ECS service is integrated with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) that is configured to distribute incoming traffic across the tasks in different AZs.
    - Verify that the ELB health checks are set up correctly to route traffic only to healthy instances, further enhancing fault tolerance.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Deploy the updated ECS configurations in a staging environment and simulate AZ failures to validate that the application continues to operate correctly with instances in other AZs.
    - Monitor the distribution of tasks across AZs to ensure they are spread evenly and that scaling operations maintain this balance.

5. **Documentation and Rollout**:
    - Document the updated ECS configurations, including the placement strategies and any changes made to task definitions or load balancer settings.
    - Roll out the changes to the production environment, monitoring closely for any issues and ensuring the application scales equally across AZs.

### Testing
- Deploy the updated ECS service configuration in a non-production environment to verify that tasks are distributed evenly across AZs.
- Simulate an AZ failure by terminating instances in one AZ to ensure that the remaining instances in other AZs continue to handle traffic without service disruption.
- Test the load balancer integration to confirm it correctly routes traffic to healthy instances across all AZs.
- Monitor metrics such as task distribution, instance health, and traffic patterns to validate the effectiveness of the updated configuration.

### External Dependencies
- Access to AWS ECS, Elastic Load Balancer, and related services for updating configurations and testing.
- Collaboration with the operations team to validate the updated configurations and monitor deployment in the production environment.
- Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track task distribution and instance health across AZs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have updated the ECS service configuration to use a placement strategy that ensures even distribution of tasks across multiple AZs.
- Should have validated that tasks are evenly distributed and that the application can handle an AZ failure without service disruption.
- Should have ensured that the load balancer is correctly configured to route traffic to instances across different AZs.
- Should have documented the updated ECS configuration and rollout process for future reference.
- Should have monitored the deployment to ensure that the changes maintain high availability and resilience of the application.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Even Distribution of Tasks Across AZs
Given the updated ECS configurations,
When the service scales out,
Then tasks should be evenly distributed across multiple AZs, reducing the potential blast radius in case of an AZ failure.

#### Scenario: Application Resilience During AZ Failure
Given the distribution of tasks across AZs,
When an AZ failure occurs,
Then the application should continue to operate correctly using instances in the other available AZs.

#### Scenario: Monitoring and Validation of AZ Distribution
Given the deployment of the updated ECS configuration,
When the system is monitored,
Then it should show an even distribution of tasks across AZs and balanced traffic routing by the load balancer.
