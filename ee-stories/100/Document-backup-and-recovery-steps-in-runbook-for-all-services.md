# Document backup and recovery steps in runbook for all services
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to document backup and recovery steps for all services in the runbook, **So That** teams can follow a standardized procedure for creating backups and recovering services in the event of a failure, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.

This story focuses on creating a detailed runbook that outlines the steps for backing up and recovering each service, ensuring that backup processes are clearly defined and recovery operations can be performed efficiently and accurately.

### Vision
By documenting backup and recovery steps in a runbook, we ensure that teams have clear guidelines for handling service failures, restoring data, and minimizing downtime. This improves incident response, enhances business continuity, and provides a reliable reference for both routine backups and emergency recoveries.

### Background
Backup and recovery are critical components of disaster recovery and business continuity planning. Without proper documentation, teams may struggle to perform timely and accurate recovery operations, leading to increased downtime and potential data loss. By standardizing these processes, we reduce risk and improve response times during incidents.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to document the backup and recovery steps for each service in the runbook, ensuring that the processes are standardized, repeatable, and easily accessible during service outages or data loss events.

## Details
### 1. Define the Services to Be Backed Up
Identify all the services that require backup and recovery procedures. These services may include:
  - **Databases**: SQL, NoSQL, or other databases used by the application (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB).
  - **File Storage**: Data stored in file systems or object storage services (e.g., S3).
  - **Application State**: Stateful application services, configuration files, or session data.
  - **Infrastructure**: Cloud infrastructure such as EC2, EBS volumes, or Kubernetes resources.
  - **Logs and Monitoring Data**: Logs and monitoring data that may be required for troubleshooting.

### 2. Document Backup Procedures
For each service, document the process for creating and managing backups, including:
  - **Backup Frequency**: Define how often backups should be taken (e.g., daily, weekly, hourly).
  - **Backup Retention**: Define how long backups should be retained (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
  - **Backup Storage**: Specify where backups are stored (e.g., AWS S3, EBS snapshots, external backup services).
  - **Automated Backups**: Indicate whether backups are automated using tools like AWS Backup or custom scripts.
  - **Manual Backup Steps**: Provide instructions for taking manual backups when necessary.

#### Example Backup Procedure for an RDS Database:
- **Service**:  RDS (MySQL)
- **Backup Frequency**: Daily automated backups at 2 AM UTC.
- **Backup Retention**: 7-day retention period for daily backups.
- **Backup Storage**: Backups are stored in the same AWS region using RDS automated snapshots.
- **Automated Backup**: Backups are automated using AWS RDS backup configuration.
- **Manual Backup**:
  1. Open the ** RDS Console**.
  2. Select the database instance.
  3. Choose **Actions** > **Take Snapshot**.
  4. Name the snapshot and click **Create**.
  5. Verify that the snapshot is created in the **Snapshots** tab.

#### Example Backup Procedure for S3:
- **Service**: AWS S3 (File Storage)
- **Backup Frequency**: Weekly full backup of all objects.
- **Backup Retention**: Backups are kept for 30 days.
- **Backup Storage**: S3 cross-region replication to a secondary region.
- **Automated Backup**: Backups are configured via AWS Lifecycle policies to replicate and archive data.
- **Manual Backup**:
  1. Use the AWS CLI or S3 Console to download and archive S3 objects.
  2. Example CLI command:
     ```bash
     aws s3 sync s3://my-bucket s3://backup-bucket --region us-east-1
     ```

### 3. Document Recovery Procedures
For each service, document the steps required to recover the service from a backup in case of failure. Include:
  - **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Define the maximum time allowed for recovery.
  - **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Define the maximum allowable data loss (e.g., up to the last backup).
  - **Recovery Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for recovering the service from a backup.
  - **Validation Steps**: Steps to validate that the recovery was successful, including data integrity checks and service health checks.
  - **Dependencies**: Note any services or resources that must be restored first or concurrently.

#### Example Recovery Procedure for RDS Database:
- **Service**:  RDS (MySQL)
- **RTO**: 30 minutes
- **RPO**: Last backup (up to 24 hours of data loss)
- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Open the ** RDS Console**.
  2. Navigate to the **Snapshots** tab.
  3. Select the most recent snapshot.
  4. Choose **Restore Snapshot** and specify the new database instance name.
  5. Configure instance settings (e.g., instance class, security groups).
  6. Click **Restore** and monitor the status.
  7. Once the instance is available, point your application to the new database endpoint.
  8. If needed, apply any missing data from logs or other sources.
- **Validation Steps**:
  1. Verify that the database is restored and accessible via the new endpoint.
  2. Run a query to check data integrity.
  3. Perform application-level tests to ensure that the database is functioning correctly.

#### Example Recovery Procedure for S3:
- **Service**: AWS S3 (File Storage)
- **RTO**: 1 hour
- **RPO**: Last backup (up to 7 days of data loss for files not in the backup)
- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Identify the backup location in the secondary region.
  2. Use the AWS CLI or S3 Console to restore the files from the backup.
  3. Example CLI command to restore:
     ```bash
     aws s3 sync s3://backup-bucket s3://my-bucket --region us-east-1
     ```
  4. Confirm that all files have been restored.
- **Validation Steps**:
  1. Verify that all files are present in the primary S3 bucket.
  2. Ensure that file integrity checks pass.
  3. Validate that the application or service dependent on S3 is functioning as expected.

### 4. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts
Ensure that monitoring and alerting systems are in place to track the success or failure of backups and recoveries:
  - **Backup Monitoring**: Use tools like **AWS CloudWatch** or **Datadog** to monitor the status of backups (e.g., AWS RDS automated backups, S3 replication status).
  - **Alerting**: Set up alerts to notify the team if a backup fails or if recovery takes longer than the defined RTO.
  - **Automated Recovery Validation**: Implement automated validation scripts that can check the integrity of restored services and report issues.

#### Example CloudWatch Alert for Failed RDS Backup:
- Set up a **CloudWatch Alarm** to monitor the status of RDS backups:
  1. Go to the **CloudWatch Console**.
  2. Create a new **Alarm** on the RDS backup metric (e.g., `RDS Automated Backup Failure`).
  3. Set the threshold to trigger if a backup fails.
  4. Configure an **SNS Notification** to alert the DevOps team.

### 5. Include Dependency and Failover Information
Document any dependencies between services and how failover mechanisms are handled. For example, if a database fails, the service may have to switch to a read replica or another region.

- **Failover Steps**: Document the steps required to fail over to a replica or another region if the primary service is unavailable.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Include a diagram or reference that shows which services depend on each other and how they are affected during backup and recovery operations.

### 6. Add Recovery Steps for Disaster Scenarios
Include specific procedures for disaster recovery (DR) scenarios where multiple services are impacted. This could include:
  - **Multi-Region Failures**: Steps to recover services in an alternate region if the primary region is down.
  - **Complete Infrastructure Failure**: Steps to restore critical infrastructure (e.g., EC2, EBS, RDS, S3) in the event of a total outage.

#### Example Disaster Recovery Steps:
1. **Identify Affected Services**: Use monitoring tools to identify which services are down.
2. **Activate Disaster Recovery Plan**: Switch to a failover region if available.
3. **Restore Critical Infrastructure**: Follow the recovery procedures for each critical service, starting with databases and core infrastructure.
4. **Validate and Test Services**: Ensure that the restored services are functioning properly.
5. **Communicate Status**: Keep stakeholders informed of recovery progress.

### 7. Ensure Runbook Accessibility and Maintenance
- **Runbook Accessibility**: Ensure the runbook is easily accessible by all team members, either through a shared document repository, Confluence, or a dedicated wiki page.
- **Runbook Updates**: Regularly update the runbook as new services are added, backup procedures change, or recovery steps are optimized.

### Testing
- **Backup Test**: Test that backups for all services are running as expected according to the defined schedule.
- **Recovery Test**: Simulate a failure scenario and ensure that the recovery steps can be followed to successfully restore the service.
- **Disaster Recovery Test**: Conduct periodic disaster recovery drills to verify that services can be restored in an alternate region or infrastructure.

### External Dependencies
- **AWS Backup**: Use AWS Backup for automating and managing backups of RDS, DynamoDB, EBS, and other resources.
- **S3 Cross-Region Replication**: For S3 backups, ensure that cross-region replication is configured.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use CloudWatch, Datadog, or other monitoring tools to track the status of backups and recoveries.
- **Alerting Services**: Use SNS, PagerDuty, or another alerting service to notify the team of backup failures or extended recovery times.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have documented backup procedures for all services, including frequency, retention, and storage.
- Should have documented recovery steps for all services, including RTO, RPO, and step-by-step instructions.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Performing a Backup for RDS
Given the RDS database is operational,
When the backup process is triggered,
Then a snapshot should be taken, stored in the defined location, and retained for the specified period.

#### Scenario: Recovering Data from S3 Backup
Given that a service outage has occurred,
When the recovery process is initiated,
Then the system should restore files from the S3 backup and validate data integrity.

#### Scenario: Alerting on Backup Failure
Given the backup process is scheduled,
When a backup fails,
Then an alert should be sent to the DevOps team to investigate and resolve the issue.
