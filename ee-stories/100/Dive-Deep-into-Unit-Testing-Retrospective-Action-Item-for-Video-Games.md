# Dive Deep into Unit Testing - Retrospective Action Item for Video Games
### Summary
**AS a** Developer
**I WANT** to dive deep into unit testing and explore useful unit test practices
**SO** we can improve the quality and reliability of our code.

### Additional Context
Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development to ensure code correctness and catch bugs early. We want to delve deeper into unit testing practices, including exploring new strategies and best practices. This will help us enhance our unit tests, making them more effective and valuable in validating our code.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Should have** scheduled a dedicated time to discuss and explore unit testing practices.
- **Should have** conducted a session to discuss useful unit test practices, such as test-driven development (TDD), mocking, and test coverage.
- **Should have** proposed new strategies and best practices for writing meaningful and effective unit tests.
- **Should have** provided examples and demonstrations of implementing the proposed unit testing strategies.
- **Should have** encouraged team members to apply the new strategies in their code and share their experiences.
- **Should have** documented the discussed unit testing practices and strategies for reference.
- **Should have** integrated the new unit testing practices into our development workflow.
- **Should have** monitored the impact of the new unit testing practices on code quality and reliability.
