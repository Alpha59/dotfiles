# Use a Moving Average to Predict Sprint Capacity - Retrospective Action Item for Tater Tots
### Summary
**AS a** Sprint Facilitator
**I WANT** to use a moving average to predict sprint capacity
**SO** we can better plan and allocate work for upcoming sprints.

### Additional Context
Predicting sprint capacity accurately is crucial for effective sprint planning and workload distribution. This story focuses on implementing a moving average method to forecast team capacity for upcoming sprints. By analyzing historical data and trends, we can improve our sprint planning process and ensure a balanced workload for the team.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Should have** collected historical data on team capacity and workload for previous sprints.
- **Should have** calculated a moving average of team capacity using the historical data.
- **Should have** analyzed the trends and patterns in the moving average to predict future sprint capacity.
- **Should have** integrated the moving average prediction into our sprint planning process.
- **Should have** used the predicted sprint capacity to allocate work and set realistic sprint goals.
- **Should have** monitored the accuracy of the moving average prediction compared to actual team capacity.
- **Should have** adjusted the moving average calculation and prediction methods based on feedback and results.
- **Should have** documented the process and guidelines for using the moving average to predict sprint capacity.
- **Should have** trained team members on interpreting and using the predicted sprint capacity for planning.

Using a moving average to predict sprint capacity?
Create a tier-2 input queue (just punt to next sprint tho)?
