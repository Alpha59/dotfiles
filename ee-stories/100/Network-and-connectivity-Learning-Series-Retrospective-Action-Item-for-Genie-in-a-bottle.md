# Network and connectivity Learning Series - Retrospective Action Item for Genie in a bottle
## Summary
**AS an** Engineer
**I WANT** to unblock network and connectivity issues, as well as permissions and requests between services
**SO** we can improve our understanding and implementation of networking with VPCs/VPCEs and RDS (Relational Database Service) VPCE in CDK (Cloud Development Kit) projects.

## Additional Context
There have been recent network and connectivity issues affecting our services, causing delays and disruptions. Additionally, there is a need to enhance our understanding of networking concepts such as VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds), VPCEs (VPC Endpoints), and RDS VPCEs.

To address these issues, I propose creating a DS2 Learning series focused on networking with VPCs/VPCEs and RDS VPCE, with a specific focus on examples and implementation in CDK. This learning series will provide team members with the knowledge and skills to troubleshoot and resolve network issues, as well as effectively configure permissions and requests between services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Should have created a DS2 Learning series focused on networking with VPCs/VPCEs and RDS VPCE.
- Should have developed educational materials, presentations, and demos to illustrate networking concepts in CDK.
- Should have presented the Learning series to the team and the wider organization.
- Should have included practical examples and use cases of networking configurations using CDK.
- Should have covered topics such as VPC creation, subnetting, security groups, route tables, VPCE setup, and RDS VPCE integration.
- Should have provided guidance on troubleshooting network and connectivity issues within VPCs/VPCEs and RDS VPCE environments.
- Should have demonstrated how to configure permissions and requests between services using IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies.
- Should have encouraged team members to actively participate in the Learning series and ask questions.
- Should have collected feedback from participants to gauge the effectiveness and relevance of the Learning series.
- Should have documented the key takeaways and learnings from the sessions for future reference.
- Should have made the educational materials and presentations accessible to team members for self-study and reference.
- Should have scheduled follow-up sessions or workshops for hands-on practice and further exploration of networking concepts.
- Should have provided support and assistance to team members in applying the knowledge gained from the Learning series to their projects.
- Should have monitored and evaluated improvements in network troubleshooting and configuration skills among team members following the Learning series.
