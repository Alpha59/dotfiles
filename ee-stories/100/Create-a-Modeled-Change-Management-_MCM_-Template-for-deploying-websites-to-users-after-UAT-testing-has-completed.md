# Create a Modeled Change Management (MCM) Template for deploying websites to users after UAT testing has completed
## Summary
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the Story, at a high level, as well as include any additional resources needed to complete the Story.)

As an Operations manager, I want an Modeled Change Management (MCM) to facilitate the deployment of websites to users after successful User Acceptance Testing (UAT), ensuring a standardized and controlled release process.

## Additional Context
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the story as well as include any additional resources needed to accomplish the Story.)

Develop an MCM Template for deploying websites, integrating it into the existing release process. This template should include the necessary steps and checks to ensure a smooth deployment post-UAT testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
[//]:# (This is a very explicit list of everything that is required to be completed, in the past tense, to finish the story. Each line starts with 'should have'.)

- Should have an MCM Template that outlines the deployment steps.
- Should have integration with the existing release process, allowing for seamless deployment post-UAT.
- Should have predefined checks and validations to ensure a controlled and error-free deployment.
- Should have documentation outlining the usage of the MCM Template.
