# Consistency with Punting in the Sprint Planning Meeting and When Adding New Tasks Mid-Sprint - Retrospective Action Item for Owl
### Summary
**AS a** Team Member
**I WANT** to maintain consistency with punting in the sprint planning meeting and when adding new tasks mid-sprint
**SO** we can effectively manage our sprint commitments and priorities.

### Additional Context
Punting tasks, or moving them to future sprints, is a common practice to manage unexpected changes or shifting priorities during a sprint. However, it's important to maintain consistency in how and when we punt tasks, both during the sprint planning meeting and when new tasks arise mid-sprint. This ensures clarity and transparency in our sprint commitments and helps us manage our workload effectively.
