# Migrating React Application from Java Backend to API Gateway
*Repeated for each of the 4 applications*


### **Summary**:

**As an** operational user, **I want** our application migrated from a legacy backend, **so that** there is improved scalability and maintenance.

**As a** developer, **I want** to migrate our existing React application from a Java backend to API Gateway **so that** I have improved scalability and maintenance.

This will involve replacing backend dependencies, updating API calls, migrating logic to the frontend, and ensuring a seamless transition to API Gateway.

### **Background:**

We have an existing React application that interacts with a Java backend. To improve scalability and maintenance, we need to remove the Java backend and replace it with API Gateway for handling requests and routing. This involves migrating logic from the backend to the React code, updating clients, and removing any unnecessary backend-related code and configurations.

### **Description:**

This story outlines the steps to update the React application, removing the Java backend and integrating it with API Gateway.

1. **Assessment:**
    1. Conduct a thorough review of the existing React application to identify all dependencies on the Java backend.
    2. Document the list of API endpoints used by the frontend.
2. **Update API Calls:**
    1. Replace all calls to the Java backend with corresponding API Gateway endpoints.
    2. Modify client code, services, and components to use the new API endpoints.
3. **Migrate Logic:**
    1. Identify and migrate any backend logic or processing that should move to the frontend.
    2. Adjust the React components and services to handle this migrated logic.
4. **Remove Java Backend:**
    1. Delete all Java backend files and folders from the codebase.
    2. This includes controllers, models, and any Java-specific configurations.
5. **Clean Configuration Files:**
    1. Review configuration files (e.g., properties, environment variables) and remove any backend-specific settings.
6. **Testing:**
    1. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the React application works as expected with API Gateway.
    2. Verify that all features and functionalities remain intact.
    3. Pay close attention to error handling, routing, and permissions.
7. **Error Handling:**
    1. Ensure that error handling is updated to work with API Gateway responses.
    2. Test different error scenarios and verify that the application handles them gracefully.
8. **Permissions:**
    1. Implement any necessary authentication and authorization checks within the React code.
    2. Test user permissions and access control.
9. **Quality Assurance:**
    1. Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
    2. Validate that all backend-related code is removed, and the application remains maintainable.
10. **Deployment:**
    1. Deploy the updated application to the production environment.
    2. Monitor for any issues post-deployment and be ready to roll back if necessary.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* **Should have**: A React application successfully migrated from Java backend to API Gateway.
* **Should have**: All dependencies on the Java backend replaced with API Gateway endpoints.
* **Should have**: Backend logic and processing migrated to the frontend.
* **Should have**: Thorough testing to verify the application's functionality and error handling.
* **Should have**: Proper authentication and authorization checks implemented.
* **Should have**: Removal of all Java backend-related code.
