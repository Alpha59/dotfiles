# Refactor  APIs for Asynchronous Coding Patterns - Retrospective Action Item for L
## Summary
**As a** backend developer **I want** to refactor the   Order Service ( APIs to utilize asynchronous coding patterns in TypeScript **So That** we can improve performance, scalability, and responsiveness in our service.

### Vision
By refactoring  APIs to use asynchronous coding patterns such as async/await and Promises, we aim to enhance the service's efficiency in handling concurrent operations and improve responsiveness to client requests. This will align our service architecture with modern asynchronous programming practices, ensuring better resource utilization and reduced latency.

### Background
The current implementation of  APIs predominantly uses synchronous coding patterns, which can lead to blocking operations and reduced throughput under heavy loads. Adopting asynchronous patterns will mitigate these issues, allowing the service to handle multiple concurrent requests more effectively and improve overall system performance.

### Purpose
The purpose of this task is to refactor  APIs to leverage TypeScript's async/await and Promises for asynchronous programming. This approach will streamline code execution, reduce callback nesting, and enhance readability, while promoting non-blocking operations that align with scalable backend architectures.

## Details
To refactor  APIs for asynchronous coding patterns:
1. **API Analysis**: Review each API endpoint (Cancel return order, Complete return order, etc.) to identify synchronous operations that can be refactored to asynchronous.
2. **Code Refactoring**: Modify synchronous code blocks to use async/await for improved readability and maintainability.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms using Promises to ensure graceful recovery from asynchronous operations.
4. **Performance Testing**: Conduct performance tests to measure improvements in response times and concurrency handling after implementing asynchronous patterns.

### Testing
- Validate refactored APIs through unit tests to ensure correct implementation of async/await and Promises.
- Perform integration testing to verify performance gains and reliability under load conditions.

### External Dependencies
- Collaboration with QA team to validate performance benchmarks and ensure compatibility with existing client applications.
- Availability of test environments with simulated load scenarios for performance testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have refactored  APIs using async/await and Promises for all identified synchronous operations.
- Should demonstrate improved performance metrics in handling concurrent requests and reducing latency.
- Should pass unit tests and integration tests validating correct implementation of asynchronous coding patterns.

OE task for team best TS practice, and (a small task) to validate our existing code with it.
