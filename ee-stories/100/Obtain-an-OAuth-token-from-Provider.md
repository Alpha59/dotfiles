# Obtain an OAuth token from Provider
## Summary
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the Story, at a high level, as well as include any additional resources needed to complete the Story.)

**AS a** service,
**I WANT** to call another service to obtain an OAuth token from CloudAuth and use this CloudAuth token for authentication in subsequent service-to-service calls,
**SO** that I can securely communicate with other services without the token being tied to any user, ensuring the communication is authenticated and authorized at the service level.

## Additional Context
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the story as well as include any additional resources needed to accomplish the Story.)

CloudAuth is an OAuth 2.0 server that facilitates server-to-server communication through standard OAuth flows. In this scenario, before a service can make calls to another service, it needs to authenticate itself with CloudAuth to obtain an OAuth token. This token is then used in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to demonstrate valid authentication and authorization. The OAuth token obtained should be purely service-oriented, meaning it does not represent any user but the service itself. This process needs to be automated within the service to ensure smooth and secure communication between services.

- Should have implemented a mechanism within the service to request an OAuth token from CloudAuth using the client_credentials grant type.
    - This does not have to be in the service, it could be implemented as a Lambda or something else.
- Should have securely stored the service credentials used to authenticate with CloudAuth.
- Should have used the obtained OAuth token in the Authorization header for all subsequent service-to-service calls.
- Should have implemented token caching to avoid unnecessary requests to CloudAuth before the expiry of an existing token.
- Should have included error handling for cases where the token request or service-to-service call fails due to authentication issues.
- Should have ensured that the OAuth token is not tied to any user but is solely for service authentication.
- Should have documented the process for obtaining and using the OAuth token for service-to-service communication, including any setup required for new services to authenticate using CloudAuth.
