# Set Up Build and Deployment Pipeline
Summary
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the Story, at a high level, as well as include any additional resources needed to complete the Story.)

As a developer, I want to establish a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automating the build and deployment process.

## Additional Context
[//]:# (This should be descriptive enough to frame the story as well as include any additional resources needed to accomplish the Story.)

This story involves configuring tools and services to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring code changes are delivered consistently.
How to Implement:

1. Choose a CI/CD platform (pipelines.amazon.com)
2. ~~Configure build scripts and define build triggers~~
3. Set up deployment pipelines to deploy to development, staging, and production environments

## Acceptance Criteria
[//]:# (This is a very explicit list of everything that is required to be completed, in the past tense, to finish the story. Each line starts with 'should have'.)
[//]:# (Refer to https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/ailor/UserStoriesandTickets#HOtherAcceptanceCriteriaformats for more information on Acceptance Criteria formats)

- Should have The CI/CD pipeline is established.
- Should have code changes trigger automated builds and tests.
- Should have Successful builds trigger automated deployments to specified environments.
