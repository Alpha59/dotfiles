# Evaluate multi-service or feature redundancy for service dependencies
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to evaluate multi-service or feature redundancy in service dependencies, **So That** we can identify opportunities to consolidate or remove redundant features and services, improving system efficiency, reducing technical debt, and lowering maintenance overhead.

This story focuses on reviewing the dependencies shared across multiple services or features, determining where redundancy exists, and planning to either consolidate, deprecate, or streamline these dependencies to simplify the overall system architecture.

### Vision
By identifying and eliminating unnecessary redundancy across services, we streamline operations, reduce the chances of conflicts or misalignment between services, and optimize resource usage. This ensures that the system is leaner, easier to maintain, and less prone to duplication of functionality.

### Background
As systems evolve, it is common for services or features to accumulate redundant dependencies or even duplicate services. This can happen when different teams implement similar functionalities without aligning on common solutions. Such redundancy adds unnecessary complexity and makes managing dependencies more challenging. Reducing this duplication improves system cohesion and efficiency.

## Details
1. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Perform a comprehensive review of the dependencies used across services or features.
   - Identify where multiple services are using similar or identical dependencies that may lead to redundancy.
   - Identify services or features that are performing similar or overlapping tasks and evaluate the possibility of consolidating them into shared modules or services.

2. **Redundancy Identification**
   - Look for cases where multiple services are dependent on similar libraries, APIs, or functionality, such as:
     - Multiple services using different versions of the same library.
     - Duplicate codebases or modules that could be centralized into a shared service.
   - Evaluate areas where redundant dependencies add complexity or technical debt without delivering distinct value.

3. **Plan for Consolidation or Removal**
   - Prioritize redundant dependencies or services that can be consolidated or removed based on:
     - Impact on overall architecture.
     - Potential risks, such as version conflicts or performance degradation.
   - Propose a migration or refactoring plan for combining these dependencies into shared services or modules.

4. **Documentation and Guidelines**
   - Create a set of best practices for dependency management and service development to avoid future redundancy.
   - Ensure teams understand when and how to reuse existing services or modules rather than creating new dependencies.

### Testing
- Test any services after dependency consolidation to ensure that functionality remains intact.
- Perform integration testing to ensure no regressions occur when dependencies are removed or centralized.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified redundant dependencies or services across multiple features or services.
- Should have a plan to consolidate, remove, or streamline these dependencies.
- Should have documented best practices for future dependency management to minimize redundancy.
