# Configure and test deep DNS health checks to ensure automatic failover in case of single-AZ failure
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to configure and test deep DNS health checks to ensure automatic failover in case of a single-AZ failure, **So That** the system can seamlessly route traffic to healthy resources in another availability zone (AZ), ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

This story focuses on setting up DNS health checks that actively monitor the health of resources across multiple AZs, and configuring automatic failover mechanisms that redirect traffic in case of an AZ failure. Testing the failover will ensure that the system can handle disruptions without downtime.

### Vision
By implementing deep DNS health checks and automatic failover, we enhance the reliability and availability of the system. This setup ensures that if an availability zone fails, DNS will automatically reroute traffic to healthy resources in other zones, maintaining system availability and minimizing the impact on users.

### Background
High availability is critical for systems running in multiple AZs. Without proper health checks and failover mechanisms, a failure in one AZ can cause system downtime. Deep DNS health checks monitor the health of specific services and resources (e.g., application endpoints, databases), allowing DNS to make intelligent routing decisions in real-time. This helps ensure that the system continues operating even when a specific AZ experiences failure.

## Details
1. **Configure DNS Health Checks**
   - Use **Route 53** (or another DNS service that supports health checks) to configure deep health checks that:
     - Monitor critical endpoints or services (e.g., web servers, load balancers) in each AZ.
     - Check the health of these resources at regular intervals by performing HTTP or TCP checks.
     - Define success and failure thresholds for determining when a resource is considered unhealthy.

2. **Set Up Failover Routing Policy**
   - Implement a **Failover Routing Policy** in Route 53 to:
     - Define primary and secondary resources across AZs.
     - Ensure that traffic is routed to the primary resource unless a failure is detected, at which point traffic is redirected to the secondary resource in another AZ.
     - Test failover scenarios by simulating failure of the primary resource.

3. **Enable Multi-AZ Configuration**
   - Ensure that the application or service is deployed across multiple AZs and that DNS is configured to balance traffic between them.
   - Verify that each AZ has the necessary resources (e.g., web servers, databases) to handle traffic independently in case of failover.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Set up monitoring and alerting in **CloudWatch** or another monitoring service to:
     - Track the status of DNS health checks.
     - Send alerts if a resource in an AZ becomes unhealthy or if a failover occurs.

5. **Testing Failover Mechanism**
   - Simulate an AZ failure by manually stopping services or marking resources as unhealthy in one AZ.
   - Confirm that the DNS health checks detect the failure and Route 53 automatically reroutes traffic to the healthy resources in the secondary AZ.
   - Monitor traffic to ensure that users experience no downtime or degradation in service during the failover process.

6. **Failback Configuration**
   - Once the failed AZ or resource becomes healthy again, test the **failback** process by ensuring DNS returns traffic to the primary resource.
   - Verify that failback is seamless and does not cause disruptions.

### Testing
- Test DNS health checks to ensure they correctly identify healthy and unhealthy resources across AZs.
- Simulate AZ failures and verify that automatic failover redirects traffic to healthy resources in a different AZ.
- Test the failback mechanism to ensure traffic returns to the primary resource once it recovers.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have configured DNS health checks for critical resources across multiple AZs.
- Should have set up automatic failover to redirect traffic during AZ failure.
- Should have tested failover and failback processes to ensure seamless recovery.
- Should have set up monitoring and alerting for DNS health checks and failover events.
