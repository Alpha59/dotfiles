# Add performance tests for System Stability to Pipeline
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add performance tests for system stability to the CI/CD pipeline, **So That** we can continuously validate the system's ability to handle stress and ensure its stability under various load conditions, preventing potential performance issues in production.

This story focuses on integrating performance and stability tests into the existing CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the system remains stable and performant under expected and peak load scenarios, helping to identify bottlenecks or vulnerabilities before they reach production.

### Vision
By adding performance tests for system stability to the pipeline, we ensure that the system is thoroughly tested for scalability and robustness as part of the development lifecycle. This reduces the risk of failures in production due to performance issues and provides confidence in the systemâ€™s ability to handle increasing load over time.

### Background
System stability is critical for maintaining performance during periods of high traffic or stress. While unit and integration tests check functional correctness, performance tests assess the system's ability to handle load without degrading performance. Including these tests in the pipeline allows for early detection of issues related to system bottlenecks, resource usage, and response times.

## Details
1. **Select Performance Testing Tool**
   - Choose a performance testing tool that integrates easily into the existing CI/CD pipeline. Options include:
     - **JMeter**: For load testing and performance monitoring.
     - **Gatling**: For high-performance load testing.
     - **k6**: For modern performance testing with an easy-to-use scripting interface.

2. **Test Scenarios**
   - Define key performance test scenarios to measure system stability, including:
     - **Load Testing**: Simulate normal and peak traffic to ensure the system handles expected load.
     - **Stress Testing**: Push the system beyond its capacity to identify breaking points.
     - **Soak Testing**: Run tests over an extended period to ensure stability under sustained load.

3. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Integrate performance tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run after functional tests. Use a performance testing tool that can generate reports on:
     - Response times.
     - Error rates.
     - CPU and memory usage under load.
   - Set up thresholds and alerts to flag performance degradation or failures in the pipeline.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**
   - Ensure that test results are captured in a format that provides actionable insights, including:
     - Detailed reports on resource usage and response times.
     - Alerts when performance thresholds are breached.
   - Store performance metrics in a centralized dashboard (e.g., using Grafana or another monitoring tool) for easy access and analysis.

5. **Testing and Iteration**
   - Regularly review and update performance test scenarios based on system changes or new features.
   - Incorporate feedback from performance tests to optimize system resources and improve stability.

### Testing
- Simulate expected and peak load conditions to validate system stability.
- Monitor and analyze resource usage and response times during performance tests.
- Verify that the pipeline alerts on performance issues when system thresholds are exceeded.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have integrated performance tests for system stability into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Should monitor key metrics like response times and resource usage under load.
- Should have performance thresholds and alerts configured to identify potential issues.
