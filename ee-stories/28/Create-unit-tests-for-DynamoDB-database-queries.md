# Create unit tests for DynamoDB database queries
### Summary
**As a** Software Developer, **I want** to create unit tests for DynamoDB database queries, **So That** we can verify that the queries return the correct results and behave as expected under different conditions, ensuring the reliability of our data layer.

This story focuses on building unit tests to validate DynamoDB queries, ensuring they return accurate data, handle edge cases, and throw appropriate errors when necessary. Unit tests will help maintain query logic correctness and provide confidence in the system’s data operations.

### Vision
By implementing unit tests for DynamoDB queries, we ensure that our data layer is well-tested, reliable, and able to handle various input conditions. These tests will also help catch issues early in the development process and ensure that changes to the query logic do not introduce regressions.

### Background
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that relies on query operations to retrieve data. These queries are often complex and may involve filtering, key conditions, pagination, or conditional logic. Testing these queries ensures that the correct data is returned and that the queries behave as expected in different scenarios. Proper unit testing helps catch bugs early and maintains data integrity throughout the system.

## Details
1. **Set Up Unit Testing Framework**
   - Use a unit testing framework such as **Jest** (for Node.js), **pytest** (for Python), or **JUnit** (for Java) to structure and run the tests.
   - Mock DynamoDB interactions using libraries like **AWS SDK Mock** for Node.js or **Moto** for Python to simulate DynamoDB operations without making real calls to AWS services.

2. **Write Test Cases for Common Query Scenarios**
   - **Basic Query Test**: Verify that the query returns the expected results for a standard request.
   - **Key Condition Test**: Ensure that the query returns the correct data when filtering by partition and sort keys.
   - **Filtering Test**: Validate that additional filters applied to the query return only matching items.
   - **Pagination Test**: Check that paginated queries return the correct results across multiple pages.

3. **Write Test Cases for Edge Cases**
   - **Empty Result Set**: Ensure the query behaves correctly when no items match the criteria.
   - **Invalid Parameters**: Validate that the system handles invalid input parameters gracefully (e.g., missing required keys).
   - **Large Data Set**: Simulate a query with a large data set to ensure it handles limits and pagination correctly.
   - **Conditional Checks**: Test queries that rely on conditional checks, ensuring they pass or fail as expected.

4. **Handle Error Scenarios**
   - **Connection Issues**: Simulate connection issues or DynamoDB service unavailability and ensure that the query throws appropriate errors.
   - **Throttling**: Mock scenarios where DynamoDB throttles requests and ensure that retries or appropriate error handling is in place.

5. **Mocking DynamoDB with Unit Tests**
   - Use a mocking library to simulate DynamoDB behavior in a controlled environment:
     - For **Node.js**, use **AWS SDK Mock** to mock DynamoDB’s `get`, `query`, `scan`, and `put` operations:
       ```javascript
       const AWSMock = require('aws-sdk-mock');
       const DynamoDB = require('aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb');

       AWSMock.mock('DynamoDB.DocumentClient', 'query', (params, callback) => {
         callback(null, { Items: [{ id: '123', name: 'Test Item' }] });
       });
       ```
     - For **Python**, use **Moto** to simulate DynamoDB’s behavior:
       ```python
       from moto import mock_dynamodb2
       import boto3

       @mock_dynamodb2
       def test_query_dynamodb():
           dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='us-east-1')
           table = dynamodb.create_table(
               TableName='TestTable',
               KeySchema=[{'AttributeName': 'id', 'KeyType': 'HASH'}],
               AttributeDefinitions=[{'AttributeName': 'id', 'AttributeType': 'S'}],
               ProvisionedThroughput={'ReadCapacityUnits': 5, 'WriteCapacityUnits': 5},
           )
           table.put_item(Item={'id': '123', 'name': 'Test Item'})
           result = table.get_item(Key={'id': '123'})
           assert result['Item']['name'] == 'Test Item'
       ```

6. **Integration with CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Ensure that the unit tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline to catch any issues introduced during code updates or refactoring.
   - Configure the pipeline to fail if any DynamoDB query test does not pass, ensuring high code quality and query reliability.

### Testing
- Run tests with different inputs and edge cases to verify that all query scenarios are covered.
- Simulate DynamoDB failures or service limits (e.g., throttling) to ensure the query logic handles these cases appropriately.
- Test with mock DynamoDB data to ensure the test cases are isolated and independent of actual AWS infrastructure.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have unit tests covering basic and complex DynamoDB queries, ensuring they return the expected results.
- Should have tests for edge cases, such as empty result sets, invalid inputs, and large data sets.
- Should have tests for error scenarios, including service unavailability, throttling, and query timeouts.
- Should be able to mock DynamoDB interactions in unit tests without making real calls to AWS.
- Should integrate unit tests with the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring automatic validation of DynamoDB queries.
