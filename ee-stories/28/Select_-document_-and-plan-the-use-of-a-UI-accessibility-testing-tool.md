# Select, document, and plan the use of a UI accessibility testing tool
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to select, document, and plan the use of a UI accessibility testing tool, **So That** we can ensure that our web applications meet accessibility standards and provide an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities.

This story focuses on choosing an appropriate UI accessibility testing tool, documenting how it will be used in development workflows, and planning its integration into the existing testing pipeline to ensure ongoing compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

### Vision
By implementing a UI accessibility testing tool, we aim to automatically identify accessibility issues, ensure compliance with legal and industry standards, and improve the usability of our web applications for all users, regardless of their abilities.

### Background
Ensuring web accessibility is both a legal requirement and a best practice for providing a positive user experience. Automated UI accessibility testing tools help identify issues like missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, and improper use of ARIA attributes, allowing teams to fix issues early in development.

## Details
1. **Tool Selection**
   - Select an accessibility testing tool that integrates well with the current technology stack and CI/CD pipeline. Popular tools include:
     - **Axe by Deque**: A widely used tool for testing WCAG compliance.
     - **Lighthouse**: Google’s tool for testing accessibility alongside performance and SEO.
     - **Pa11y**: An open-source tool that runs accessibility tests in a variety of formats.
   - Ensure the tool supports key accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) and can integrate with common browsers and frameworks.

2. **Documentation and Guidelines**
   - Create documentation for the development team that explains:
     - How to install and configure the tool.
     - How to run accessibility tests (e.g., within the local development environment or as part of the CI/CD pipeline).
     - What types of accessibility issues the tool detects (e.g., contrast, ARIA roles, form labels).
     - Best practices for resolving common accessibility issues.
   - Include usage examples and error reporting guidelines in the documentation.

3. **Integration into the Development Workflow**
   - Plan to integrate the tool into the development lifecycle:
     - **Local Development**: Enable developers to run accessibility checks locally during UI development.
     - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate the tool into the automated build pipeline to run accessibility tests on pull requests or after deployment to staging.
   - Set up failure thresholds in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent deployments if critical accessibility issues are detected.

4. **Training and Onboarding**
   - Schedule training sessions or create onboarding materials to help developers understand the importance of accessibility testing and how to use the tool effectively.
   - Ensure all team members know how to interpret the tool’s results and implement fixes.

5. **Ongoing Maintenance and Reporting**
   - Establish regular reviews of accessibility test results to track compliance and measure progress.
   - Set up reporting mechanisms (e.g., dashboards in Jenkins, GitLab, or GitHub) to display ongoing accessibility compliance across projects.

### Testing
- Run the selected tool on current web applications to identify existing accessibility issues.
- Validate the tool’s integration in the CI/CD pipeline by simulating test runs and ensuring that issues are flagged.
- Test developer workflow by running the tool in a local environment and ensuring developers can resolve flagged issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have selected and documented a UI accessibility testing tool.
- Should have integrated the tool into the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.
- Should have created developer documentation and guidelines for using the tool.
- Should have provided training or onboarding materials for team members.
