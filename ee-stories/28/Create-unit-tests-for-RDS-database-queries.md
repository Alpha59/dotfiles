# Create unit tests for RDS database queries
### Summary
**As a** Software Developer, **I want** to create unit tests for RDS (Relational Database Service) database queries, **So That** we can verify the correctness of SQL queries and ensure the accuracy and performance of data retrieval, insertion, and modification operations.

This story focuses on creating unit tests for RDS database queries to verify that SQL operations, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, behave as expected. By implementing unit tests, we ensure that the query logic is correct, edge cases are handled, and the system remains reliable during changes or updates.

### Vision
By creating unit tests for RDS queries, we ensure that our application interacts with the database as expected, preventing issues with incorrect data retrieval or manipulation. These tests will improve confidence in the database layer and catch potential issues early in the development process.

### Background
RDS is an essential component in many applications, and its queries need to be rigorously tested to ensure data accuracy and system reliability. Testing RDS database queries, including edge cases and error handling, helps ensure that the database operations are functioning correctly. Mocking the RDS interactions allows for isolated unit tests that don't require an actual database connection.

## Details

1. **Set Up Unit Testing Framework**
   - Use a unit testing framework such as **JUnit** (for Java), **pytest** (for Python), or **Jest** (for Node.js).
   - Use a mocking library to simulate RDS interactions (e.g., **Mockito** for Java, **unittest.mock** for Python, or **pg-mock** for Node.js).

2. **Write Test Cases for Common Query Scenarios**
   - **SELECT Query Test**: Validate that the query returns the correct records for a standard `SELECT` operation.
   - **INSERT Query Test**: Ensure that the query inserts data correctly and returns the appropriate success result.
   - **UPDATE Query Test**: Verify that the `UPDATE` query modifies the correct records and updates fields accurately.
   - **DELETE Query Test**: Confirm that the `DELETE` query removes the intended records without affecting unrelated rows.

3. **Write Test Cases for Edge Cases**
   - **Empty Results**: Verify that `SELECT` queries return an empty result set when no matching records are found.
   - **Invalid Parameters**: Ensure that queries handle invalid or missing parameters (e.g., null values) gracefully without throwing errors.
   - **Constraints Handling**: Test for violations of database constraints (e.g., unique constraints, foreign key constraints) and ensure appropriate error handling.
   - **Batch Queries**: Test the behavior of bulk inserts, updates, or deletes to ensure they operate efficiently without causing errors or locking issues.

4. **Handle Error Scenarios**
   - **Connection Issues**: Simulate database connection failures and ensure that appropriate errors are thrown and handled.
   - **Timeouts**: Simulate query timeouts and ensure that the system handles them gracefully (e.g., retries or error messages).
   - **Query Failures**: Simulate syntax errors or failed queries and ensure that the system provides meaningful error messages.

5. **Mocking RDS with Unit Tests**
   - Use mocking libraries to simulate database interactions, isolating the tests from the actual database:
     - **Java (Mockito)**: Use **Mockito** to mock the behavior of `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement` for SQL queries:
       ```java
       @Test
       public void testSelectQuery() throws SQLException {
           Connection mockConnection = mock(Connection.class);
           PreparedStatement mockStatement = mock(PreparedStatement.class);
           ResultSet mockResultSet = mock(ResultSet.class);

           when(mockConnection.prepareStatement(anyString())).thenReturn(mockStatement);
           when(mockStatement.executeQuery()).thenReturn(mockResultSet);
           when(mockResultSet.next()).thenReturn(true).thenReturn(false);
           when(mockResultSet.getString('name')).thenReturn('Test Name');

           String query = 'SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1';
           PreparedStatement statement = mockConnection.prepareStatement(query);
           ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
           resultSet.next();
           assertEquals('Test Name', resultSet.getString('name'));
       }
       ```
     - **Python (unittest.mock)**: Use `unittest.mock` to mock database connections and queries:
       ```python
       from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

       @patch('psycopg2.connect')
       def test_select_query(mock_connect):
           mock_conn = mock_connect.return_value
           mock_cursor = mock_conn.cursor.return_value
           mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = ('Test Name',)

           query = 'SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1'
           cursor = mock_conn.cursor()
           cursor.execute(query)
           result = cursor.fetchone()
           assert result[0] == 'Test Name'
       ```
     - **Node.js (pg-mock)**: Use **pg-mock** to mock PostgreSQL queries:
       ```javascript
       const pgMock = require('pg-mock');
       const pool = pgMock();

       test('should return correct result for SELECT query', async () => {
           pool.add('SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1', [{ name: 'Test Name' }]);
           const res = await pool.query('SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1');
           expect(res.rows[0].name).toBe('Test Name');
       });
       ```

6. **Integration with CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Ensure that the unit tests are part of the CI/CD pipeline so they run automatically when code is pushed or merged.
   - Set the pipeline to fail if any query tests do not pass, ensuring that database interactions are always validated before deployment.

### Testing
- Simulate different query scenarios to ensure they return correct results.
- Test edge cases like empty results, invalid inputs, and constraint violations.
- Validate that error handling works as expected for connection issues, query failures, and timeouts.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have unit tests that cover basic SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- Should have tests for edge cases and error scenarios such as invalid parameters, timeouts, and constraint violations.
- Should mock RDS interactions in the unit tests without requiring a real database connection.
- Should integrate unit tests with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure automatic validation of database queries.
