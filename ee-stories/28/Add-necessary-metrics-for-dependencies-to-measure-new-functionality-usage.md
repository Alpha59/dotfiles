# Add necessary metrics for dependencies to measure new functionality usage
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add necessary metrics for dependencies to measure new functionality usage, **So That** we can track how often and how effectively the new features are being used, and monitor the performance of the underlying dependencies to ensure they are functioning properly.

This story focuses on implementing metrics to measure the usage of newly introduced functionality, including how dependencies perform under load, any potential bottlenecks, and the adoption rate of the new features.

### Vision
By implementing usage and performance metrics for dependencies supporting new functionality, we ensure that both the new features and their supporting systems are being properly monitored. This enables us to make data-driven decisions regarding optimization, scaling, and further development of the functionality.

### Background
Newly introduced features often rely on existing or new dependencies, which can experience unforeseen performance issues or usage patterns. Monitoring key metrics such as call frequency, error rates, and response times for these dependencies helps ensure that they can support the new functionality effectively.

## Details
1. **Identify Key Metrics**
   - Define metrics related to the performance and usage of the new functionality and its dependencies, such as:
     - **Usage Metrics**: Number of API calls or database queries made by the new functionality.
     - **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, and resource consumption for each dependency.
     - **Adoption Metrics**: Number of users interacting with the new features, and frequency of usage.

2. **Instrumentation**
   - Instrument the code to capture the defined metrics using monitoring tools (e.g., ** CloudWatch**, **Prometheus**, **Datadog**):
     - For API dependencies, track the number of requests, response times, and error rates.
     - For databases, monitor query performance, latency, and any potential throttling or timeouts.
     - Include metrics for each dependency involved in the new functionality.

3. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Create dashboards to visualize the collected metrics for easy monitoring:
     - Display key metrics such as API call frequency, response times, and error rates.
     - Include visualizations to track the adoption of the new functionality over time.

4. **Alerting and Thresholds**
   - Set thresholds and alerts for key metrics to notify the team if dependencies start to experience performance degradation or errors due to increased usage:
     - Alerts for increased response times or high error rates.
     - Warnings for resource exhaustion (e.g., database connection limits, API rate limits).

5. **Ongoing Monitoring and Optimization**
   - Regularly review the metrics to identify any performance bottlenecks or opportunities for optimization.
   - Use the data to determine whether scaling or adjustments are needed for dependencies supporting the new functionality.

### Testing
- Validate that the metrics are correctly captured for each dependency and reflect actual usage.
- Simulate different usage scenarios to ensure that performance metrics react appropriately under varying loads.
- Test alerting by inducing errors or performance bottlenecks to ensure the system provides timely notifications.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and implemented metrics for measuring new functionality usage and dependency performance.
- Should have created dashboards that visualize key metrics, such as usage frequency and performance of dependencies.
- Should have configured alerts to notify the team of performance issues or errors in dependencies supporting the new functionality.
