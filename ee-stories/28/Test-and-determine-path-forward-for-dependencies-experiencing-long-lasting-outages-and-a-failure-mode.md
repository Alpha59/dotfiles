# Test and determine path forward for dependencies experiencing long lasting outages and a failure mode
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to test and determine a path forward for dependencies experiencing long-lasting outages, and define a failure mode for those cases, **So That** the system can gracefully handle prolonged downtime, mitigate user impact, and ensure continued operation wherever possible.

This story focuses on identifying dependencies prone to extended outages, testing how the system behaves during these events, and developing strategies or failure modes to ensure system resilience, allowing it to either degrade gracefully or switch to alternative methods of operation.

### Vision
By testing for long-lasting outages and defining failure modes, we ensure that the system can recover from or continue functioning during dependency failures, minimizing downtime and improving the user experience even when critical services are unavailable. The failure mode will allow the system to handle these cases predictably and avoid catastrophic failures.

### Background
Many services rely on external dependencies, which may occasionally suffer from prolonged outages. Without a proper failure mode in place, these outages can lead to significant downtime, cascading failures, or negative user experiences. Establishing a clear, tested failure mode ensures that the system can handle these cases efficiently and reduce the impact on users.

## Details
1. **Identify Critical Dependencies**
   - Review the system architecture to identify external dependencies that are prone to outages or could have a significant impact if unavailable (e.g., third-party APIs, databases, microservices).
   - Prioritize dependencies based on their criticality to system operations.

2. **Simulate Long-Lasting Outages**
   - Use tools or controlled environments to simulate extended outages of these dependencies.
   - Monitor how the system responds during the outage and note any failures or degradation in performance.

3. **Determine Failure Modes**
   - Define failure modes for each dependency based on its importance and the system's tolerance for outages. These could include:
     - **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce functionality but continue providing core services (e.g., defaulting to cached data).
     - **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatically stop making requests to the failing service and trigger fallback mechanisms.
     - **Retry and Backoff Strategies**: Implement exponential backoff for retrying the service after a failure, to avoid overwhelming it when it comes back online.
     - **User Notifications**: Inform users when specific functionality is degraded due to a dependency failure.

4. **Plan for Mitigation and Recovery**
   - Establish mitigation strategies to minimize downtime:
     - **Caching**: Cache data from dependencies for critical operations during outages.
     - **Fallback Options**: Provide alternative services or data sources that can be used when a primary dependency is unavailable.
     - **Timeout and Circuit Breakers**: Set timeouts for dependencies and enable circuit breakers to cut off failing services and prevent cascading issues.

5. **Document Path Forward**
   - Document the steps for implementing the defined failure modes.
   - Include guidelines for monitoring the dependencies, automatic fallback mechanisms, and user notification protocols during outages.

### Testing
- Simulate long-lasting outages and validate the behavior of the failure modes (e.g., graceful degradation, circuit breaker triggering, fallback mechanisms).
- Ensure that the system continues functioning in a reduced capacity during an outage and that critical services remain operational.
- Verify that the user is properly informed when certain services are unavailable or degraded.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified critical dependencies and tested their behavior during simulated long-lasting outages.
- Should have defined failure modes (e.g., circuit breakers, graceful degradation) for handling outages.
- Should have documented mitigation and recovery strategies for dependencies.
- Should have verified that the system can handle outages without complete failure or significant user impact.
