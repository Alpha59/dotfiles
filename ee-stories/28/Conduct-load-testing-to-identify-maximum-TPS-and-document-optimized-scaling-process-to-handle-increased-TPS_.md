# Conduct load testing to identify maximum TPS and document optimized scaling process to handle increased TPS.
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to conduct load testing to identify the maximum Transactions Per Second (TPS) the system can handle and document the optimized scaling process, **So That** the system can efficiently handle increased traffic while maintaining performance and stability.

This story focuses on performing load testing to determine the system's TPS limits, identifying potential bottlenecks, and documenting an optimized scaling strategy to ensure the system scales smoothly as traffic increases.

### Vision
By conducting load testing and defining an optimized scaling process, we ensure the system can handle growing traffic without degradation in performance. This allows for proactive scaling and better resource utilization, preventing overloads and ensuring a seamless user experience during traffic spikes.

### Background
As traffic to the system grows, it’s essential to understand its capacity and ensure the infrastructure can scale to meet demand. Load testing helps identify the maximum TPS the system can handle before performance is impacted, and optimized scaling processes ensure that the system can dynamically adjust to varying loads, maintaining availability and performance.

## Details
1. **Set Up Load Testing Framework**
   - Use a tool like **Gatling**, **JMeter**, or **k6** to simulate large volumes of transactions.
   - Define test scenarios to simulate increasing traffic loads, measuring TPS, response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
   - Ensure that the testing environment mirrors production settings to get accurate results.

2. **Execute Load Tests**
   - Gradually increase the load to simulate growing TPS, from normal traffic to peak load conditions.
   - Monitor system behavior during testing to track when response times start to degrade, error rates increase, or resources (e.g., CPU, memory) become constrained.
   - Identify the maximum sustainable TPS the system can handle before performance is impacted.

3. **Identify Bottlenecks and Thresholds**
   - Review the test results to determine where bottlenecks occur, such as:
     - Database or API latency.
     - CPU or memory exhaustion.
     - Network or disk I/O bottlenecks.
   - Determine key performance thresholds that should trigger scaling, such as TPS, resource usage, or response time limits.

4. **Document Optimized Scaling Process**
   - Define an optimized **auto-scaling** process based on the test results:
     - Set **scaling thresholds** for CPU, memory, and TPS metrics to trigger automatic scaling of application instances, database resources, or other components.
     - Configure **AWS Auto Scaling Groups** (or similar cloud services) to dynamically add or remove instances based on traffic.
     - Ensure that **horizontal scaling** (adding instances) or **vertical scaling** (upgrading instances) is configured for the most efficient use of resources.

5. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for key metrics, such as TPS, CPU, memory, and response times, to proactively detect when scaling is needed.
   - Configure alerts to notify the team when the system is approaching maximum capacity or when scaling events occur.

6. **Optimize Scaling for Cost Efficiency**
   - Adjust the scaling process to balance performance and cost efficiency:
     - Implement **pre-scaling** for anticipated traffic spikes (e.g., during peak business hours).
     - Use **Spot Instances** or reserved instances in AWS to reduce costs during periods of high demand.
     - Set scaling cooldown periods to avoid unnecessary scaling events.

### Testing
- Run multiple load tests to validate the system’s performance at different TPS levels.
- Simulate real-world traffic patterns to ensure the scaling process is triggered at appropriate thresholds.
- Verify that the system automatically scales in response to increased TPS and maintains performance without over-provisioning resources.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified the maximum sustainable TPS the system can handle before performance degradation.
- Should have documented an optimized scaling process to handle increased TPS dynamically.
- Should have tested and verified that auto-scaling works as expected under various load conditions.
- Should have implemented monitoring and alerts for TPS, resource usage, and scaling events.
