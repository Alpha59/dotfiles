# Implement UI level throttles for users to prevent user induced retry errors
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to implement UI-level throttles for users to prevent user-induced retry errors, **So That** the application can manage high-frequency actions initiated by users, reducing server load and preventing accidental retries or flooding of requests that may result in errors.

This story focuses on implementing client-side throttling mechanisms to limit how frequently users can trigger certain actions, such as form submissions or API calls, ensuring that the system can handle the load efficiently while preventing errors caused by rapid retries.

### Vision
By introducing UI-level throttles, we ensure that users cannot overwhelm the system with excessive retries or rapid actions, thus maintaining the system's stability and avoiding unnecessary server load. This improves user experience by preventing redundant actions and error-prone retries while optimizing system performance.

### Background
User actions, such as multiple rapid submissions of forms or API requests, can lead to server-side errors, resource exhaustion, and even service degradation. Implementing throttling at the UI level prevents users from triggering actions too frequently, helping to avoid user-induced retry errors while promoting a smoother interaction experience.

## Details

1. **Identify High-Risk Actions**
   - Identify which user actions are most likely to cause retry errors or server overload, such as:
     - Form submissions.
     - API calls triggered by buttons (e.g., submit, save, or refresh).
     - Requests that involve heavy processing or querying large datasets.

2. **Design Throttling Mechanism**
   - Implement a client-side throttling mechanism (e.g., debounce or rate-limiting) to control the frequency at which certain actions can be triggered:
     - **Debouncing**: Delay processing user actions (e.g., form submissions) until a certain period has passed without additional actions.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Allow only a certain number of actions (e.g., API calls) to be triggered within a defined time window.
   - Configure the throttle time based on the nature of the action (e.g., a few seconds delay for form submissions).

3. **UI Feedback and Notifications**
   - Provide feedback to the user when throttling is applied to prevent confusion:
     - Display a message (e.g., 'Please wait before trying again') if the user attempts to perform an action that is throttled.
     - Use visual indicators such as disabling buttons or showing spinners to signal to the user that the system is processing their request.

4. **Integration into UI Components**
   - Apply the throttling mechanism to relevant UI components:
     - **Form Submissions**: Add a debounce function that prevents users from submitting forms repeatedly within a short time frame.
     - **Button Clicks**: Disable buttons or trigger rate-limiting to prevent repeated API calls in quick succession.
     - **Scroll or Load More Actions**: Use throttling to prevent excessive requests for data loading, especially in infinite scrolling.

5. **Testing Throttle Implementation**
   - Test the UI throttling mechanism across different user scenarios to ensure that:
     - Users are prevented from triggering the same action multiple times within the defined time window.
     - Throttling mechanisms do not impact legitimate user behavior or slow down normal actions unnecessarily.
   - Simulate high-frequency user actions to ensure that the throttling mechanism successfully reduces retry errors and prevents server overload.

6. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Monitor the impact of throttling on user behavior and system performance:
     - Use analytics tools to track how often throttling is triggered and whether it reduces retry errors or system load.
     - Review server logs to confirm a decrease in user-induced retries and errors.

7. **Long-Term Maintenance**
   - Adjust the throttling time window and logic based on user feedback and system performance.
   - Periodically review the most common user-induced errors and refine the UI throttling mechanisms as needed.

### Testing
- Test the throttling mechanism by simulating rapid user actions to ensure throttling is applied and no duplicate actions are triggered.
- Validate that throttling feedback is clear to the user and does not negatively impact the user experience.
- Monitor server logs and metrics to verify a reduction in retry errors and excess load.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have implemented UI-level throttles to prevent users from triggering multiple rapid actions or retry errors.
- Should provide clear feedback to users when throttling is applied.
- Should have tested and validated that throttling prevents unnecessary retries while maintaining a smooth user experience.
- Should monitor for a reduction in user-induced retry errors and an improvement in system load management.
