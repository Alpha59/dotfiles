# Conduct User base research to document missing features or bugs from all stakeholders and users
### Summary
**As a** Product Manager, **I want** to conduct user base research to document missing features or bugs reported by all stakeholders and users, **So That** we can capture valuable feedback to improve the product, prioritize feature development, and resolve critical issues that impact user experience.

This story focuses on gathering input from stakeholders and users to identify missing features and bugs, documenting the feedback, and analyzing the data to guide product development and issue resolution.

### Vision
By conducting thorough user research, we gain insights into the pain points, desired features, and unresolved bugs that affect different stakeholders. This ensures that product decisions are based on real user needs and helps the team prioritize features and fixes that have the most significant impact on the user experience.

### Background
User feedback is essential for driving product improvement. Over time, features may become outdated or misaligned with user needs, and bugs may emerge that degrade the user experience. Regularly gathering and documenting user feedback ensures that the product roadmap is aligned with user expectations and operational goals.

## Details
1. **Stakeholder and User Interviews**
   - Schedule interviews with key stakeholders, including internal teams (e.g., customer support, sales, engineering) and external users.
   - Use surveys, focus groups, or direct interviews to collect detailed feedback about missing features, desired enhancements, and unresolved bugs.

2. **Feedback Categorization**
   - Categorize feedback into three main areas:
     - **Missing Features**: Document features that users have requested but are not yet implemented.
     - **Bugs**: Record all bugs reported by users, along with the context of when and how they occur.
     - **Usability Issues**: Capture any concerns or frustrations users have with the product’s usability, even if they don’t classify as bugs or feature requests.

3. **Prioritization Criteria**
   - Analyze the feedback to identify patterns and prioritize issues based on:
     - **Severity of bugs**: Prioritize bugs that are blocking or severely affecting users.
     - **Feature demand**: Highlight missing features requested by multiple users or high-value stakeholders.
     - **Usability improvements**: Focus on user-reported issues that improve overall user experience.

4. **Documentation**
   - Create a comprehensive document that outlines:
     - Missing features and their priority.
     - Reported bugs and their severity.
     - Usability feedback and recommendations for improvement.
   - Ensure the document is accessible to all stakeholders and updated regularly.

5. **Action Plan**
   - Propose an action plan to address high-priority features and bugs.
   - Coordinate with product development and engineering teams to create tickets for feature development or bug fixes based on feedback.

### Testing
- Validate the gathered feedback by reviewing it with key stakeholders and ensuring that it aligns with actual user needs and pain points.
- Test the proposed solutions for bugs and missing features by working with a small group of users or running A/B tests to confirm effectiveness.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have gathered comprehensive feedback from all relevant stakeholders and users.
- Should have documented missing features, bugs, and usability issues.
- Should have created a prioritized action plan for addressing key issues and implementing high-demand features.
