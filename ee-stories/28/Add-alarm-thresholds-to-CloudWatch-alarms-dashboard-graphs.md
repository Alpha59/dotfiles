# Add alarm thresholds to CloudWatch alarms dashboard graphs
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add alarm thresholds to CloudWatch alarms dashboard graphs, **So That** we can visually monitor when metrics are approaching or exceeding critical limits, providing better insights for real-time system performance and preventing potential issues from escalating.

This story focuses on setting up visual threshold markers for key metrics in CloudWatch dashboard graphs, allowing users to quickly identify when thresholds are reached and take immediate action to resolve issues.

### Vision
By adding visual alarm thresholds to CloudWatch dashboards, we enhance monitoring capabilities, allowing teams to proactively detect and respond to issues as metrics approach critical limits. This improves system reliability, minimizes downtime, and helps ensure that alarms are triggered before system performance degrades.

### Background
CloudWatch allows you to set up alarms based on specific metric thresholds, but without clear visual indicators in the dashboards, it can be difficult to quickly assess if and when metrics are approaching these thresholds. Adding these markers to the dashboard graphs provides an at-a-glance view of critical performance data and ensures that teams can take immediate action when necessary.

## Details

1. **Identify Key Metrics**
   - Review the most important metrics that require monitoring with thresholds, such as:
     - **CPU Utilization**: High CPU usage may indicate that instances are overloaded.
     - **Memory Usage**: Memory spikes could lead to out-of-memory issues.
     - **Disk I/O**: High disk read/write rates may indicate storage bottlenecks.
     - **Request Latency**: Increased latency could indicate performance issues in application services.
     - **Error Rates**: An increase in error responses (e.g., 5xx errors) may signal problems with the service or infrastructure.

2. **Define Threshold Values**
   - For each metric, define appropriate threshold values that will trigger alarms. Examples include:
     - CPU Utilization above **80%**.
     - Memory Usage above **75%**.
     - Request Latency exceeding **500ms**.
     - Error Rates exceeding **2%** of total requests.
   - Work with the operations and development teams to determine realistic and meaningful thresholds based on current system behavior and business requirements.

3. **Update CloudWatch Alarms**
   - Set up or modify existing CloudWatch alarms to reflect these thresholds:
     - Ensure that alarms are configured with the appropriate threshold values and time intervals.
     - Alarms should trigger actions such as sending notifications (via SNS) or automatically scaling resources.

4. **Add Threshold Markers to Dashboard Graphs**
   - Edit the CloudWatch dashboard and add visual markers that display the defined threshold limits directly on the graphs:
     - When setting up the graph in the CloudWatch dashboard, use the **'Threshold'** option to add horizontal lines at the appropriate metric value.
     - These lines will serve as visual guides, allowing users to easily see when a metric is approaching or exceeding the defined threshold.
   - Set color-coded markers (e.g., red for critical thresholds, orange for warning levels) to highlight the severity.

5. **Test Alarm and Threshold Visualization**
   - Simulate system activity to trigger the thresholds and ensure that the visual markers appear correctly on the dashboard.
   - Verify that the alarms trigger at the defined thresholds and that notifications or automated actions occur as expected.

6. **Documentation and Communication**
   - Document the purpose of each threshold, the metrics being monitored, and the defined limits.
   - Share this information with the operations team so that they are aware of the thresholds and understand the action required when metrics approach or exceed these limits.

### Testing
- Simulate system load or failures that exceed the defined thresholds to verify that the markers appear on the dashboard.
- Ensure that CloudWatch alarms are triggered when thresholds are breached and that alerts are sent.
- Verify that the visual markers on the dashboard make it easy to spot when metrics approach critical levels.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and set appropriate thresholds for key metrics.
- Should have added visual markers on CloudWatch dashboard graphs to indicate alarm thresholds.
- Should have tested the alarms and verified that alerts are triggered and visible on the dashboard.
- Should have provided documentation on the thresholds and communicated the changes to relevant teams.
