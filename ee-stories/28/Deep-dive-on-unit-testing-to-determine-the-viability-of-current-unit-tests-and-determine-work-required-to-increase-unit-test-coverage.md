# Deep dive on unit testing to determine the viability of current unit tests and determine work required to increase unit test coverage
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to perform a deep dive on the current state of unit testing to determine the viability and effectiveness of existing unit tests and identify the work required to increase unit test coverage, **So That** we can ensure the quality and stability of the codebase by catching issues early and providing a higher degree of test coverage across critical functions.

This story focuses on evaluating the current unit tests for functionality, identifying gaps in coverage, and developing a plan to improve and extend unit test coverage across the codebase. It aims to enhance confidence in the codebase, reduce technical debt, and provide faster feedback in the CI/CD pipeline.

### Vision
By thoroughly reviewing the current state of unit tests and identifying gaps in coverage, we will improve the overall quality and reliability of the codebase. Increased test coverage helps ensure that code is well-tested, bugs are caught early in development, and future changes are less likely to introduce regressions.

### Background
Unit testing is essential for maintaining high code quality, but incomplete or outdated test coverage can lead to vulnerabilities and bugs slipping into production. This story is aimed at evaluating the current state of unit tests, determining whether they are effective and comprehensive, and identifying areas where coverage needs to be improved.

## Details

1. **Evaluate Current Unit Test Coverage**
   - Use code coverage tools such as **Istanbul** (for JavaScript), **pytest-cov** (for Python), **JaCoCo** (for Java), or similar tools to generate a report on current unit test coverage.
   - Review the code coverage report to identify the percentage of the codebase that is currently covered by unit tests, broken down by modules, functions, and classes.
   - Assess whether key components and business logic are adequately covered by existing tests.

2. **Review the Quality and Effectiveness of Existing Tests**
   - Conduct a manual review of the current unit tests to evaluate their effectiveness. Determine if they:
     - Accurately test the core functionality of the application.
     - Include edge cases and negative scenarios.
     - Properly mock external dependencies to ensure isolated testing.
   - Identify tests that are outdated, redundant, or insufficiently thorough, and mark them for improvement or removal.

3. **Identify Gaps in Coverage**
   - Identify critical sections of the codebase that are either under-tested or completely untested:
     - Business-critical functions.
     - Edge case scenarios (e.g., error handling, unusual inputs).
     - Complex algorithms or logic-heavy modules.
   - Pay particular attention to areas of the code that have a history of bugs or that are prone to frequent changes, as these are high-priority for additional testing.

4. **Determine the Work Required to Increase Test Coverage**
   - Prioritize areas of the codebase where increased unit test coverage will provide the most value.
   - Create a roadmap for increasing coverage, including:
     - Developing new tests for under-tested or untested areas.
     - Refactoring existing tests for clarity, coverage, or effectiveness.
     - Removing or updating obsolete tests that no longer align with the current functionality of the code.
   - Estimate the amount of work required to bring the codebase to an acceptable level of unit test coverage (e.g., 80% or higher, depending on project needs).

5. **Automate Code Coverage Reporting**
   - Integrate automated coverage reports into the CI/CD pipeline to provide real-time feedback on the state of test coverage after each build.
   - Set minimum coverage thresholds in the pipeline to prevent new code from being merged if it reduces overall test coverage or does not meet the required standard.
   - Configure alerts to notify the team when code coverage falls below an acceptable level.

6. **Plan for Continuous Improvement**
   - Set up a schedule for regular code coverage reviews, ensuring that test coverage is maintained as new code is added or as existing code is refactored.
   - Establish best practices for writing unit tests, including guidelines on what should be tested, how to mock dependencies, and how to handle edge cases.
   - Provide training or documentation to help developers write effective and comprehensive unit tests.

### Testing
- Use code coverage tools to generate a report and validate that the coverage data is accurate and reflects the current state of the codebase.
- Review the quality of existing unit tests to ensure they adequately cover the core functionality and edge cases.
- Develop new tests in areas identified as lacking coverage and verify that coverage improves without introducing false positives or negatives.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a detailed code coverage report, with identified areas of the codebase that require additional testing.
- Should have reviewed existing unit tests for quality, effectiveness, and relevance.
- Should have created a roadmap for increasing unit test coverage, prioritizing critical areas of the codebase.
- Should have integrated code coverage reporting into the CI/CD pipeline to track coverage and enforce standards.
- Should have outlined best practices and provided guidance for ongoing unit test development.

By conducting this deep dive into unit test coverage, we ensure that the codebase is better tested, more reliable, and less prone to regressions, improving overall system quality and developer confidence.
