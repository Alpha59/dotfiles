# Establish and enforce TPS limits for each API caller
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to establish and enforce Transaction Per Second (TPS) limits for each API caller, **So That** we can prevent overloading the system, ensure fair usage, and maintain optimal performance for all users.

This story focuses on defining and implementing TPS limits for API callers, ensuring that requests are throttled and managed based on predefined thresholds to prevent API abuse and protect system resources.

### Vision
By enforcing TPS limits, we ensure that no single API caller can overwhelm the system, which improves stability, performance, and overall service quality. This also allows for more predictable resource usage and helps protect against spikes in demand.

### Background
APIs can be vulnerable to overload when not properly throttled, leading to performance degradation or outages. Enforcing TPS limits allows us to regulate traffic, ensuring that all clients can use the API within acceptable bounds without adversely affecting system health.

## Details
1. **Define TPS Limits**
   - Set API usage limits per caller based on client tiers (e.g., free vs. premium users).
   - Establish default TPS limits (e.g., 100 requests per second) and customize for specific clients if necessary.

2. **Implement Throttling Mechanism**
   - Use **API Gateway** or **Load Balancer** to enforce TPS limits.
   - Configure **AWS API Gateway usage plans** or similar tools to apply rate limits per API key or client.
   - Ensure that requests exceeding the limit receive appropriate HTTP response codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Set up monitoring using **CloudWatch** or **Prometheus** to track API usage and TPS violations.
   - Trigger alerts if callers consistently hit or exceed their TPS limits.

4. **Exception Handling**
   - Define a process for handling clients who consistently exceed their limits, including escalation paths or automated request rejections.

### Testing
- Test the TPS limit enforcement by simulating high API traffic from different clients and ensuring that requests are throttled accordingly.
- Validate that monitoring and alerts are triggered when limits are breached.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have defined and implemented TPS limits for each API caller.
- Should have a throttling mechanism in place that enforces TPS limits.
- Should have monitoring and alerts set up for tracking TPS violations.
