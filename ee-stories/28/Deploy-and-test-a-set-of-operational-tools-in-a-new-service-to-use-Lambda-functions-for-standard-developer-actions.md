# Deploy and test a set of operational tools in a new service to use Lambda functions for standard developer actions
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to deploy and test a set of operational tools in a new service using Lambda functions for standard developer actions, **So That** developers can perform routine tasks efficiently and consistently without needing direct access to the underlying infrastructure.

This story focuses on setting up a suite of operational tools through AWS Lambda to enable developers to perform common actions (e.g., data queries, system resets, or log retrieval) in a secure, automated, and scalable way.

### Vision
By leveraging AWS Lambda for operational tools, we ensure that standard developer actions are automated, secure, and easy to execute. This improves operational efficiency, reduces the risk of manual errors, and minimizes the need for developers to have direct access to sensitive infrastructure components.

### Background
Operational tools are critical for enabling developers to manage their environments effectively without overwhelming them with access to the infrastructure. By using Lambda functions, we can create lightweight, serverless operations that are scalable, secure, and easy to manage. This provides developers with the ability to execute common tasks such as querying data, managing services, or performing health checks on the system.

## Details
1. **Identify Key Developer Actions**
   - Define a list of standard actions that developers frequently perform, such as:
     - Data queries (e.g., fetching records from a database).
     - System resets or cache clearing.
     - Health checks or service status retrieval.
     - Log retrieval for debugging purposes.

2. **Lambda Function Setup**
   - Create a series of AWS Lambda functions for each developer action:
     - **Data Queries**: A Lambda function that runs queries against the database and returns results to the developer.
     - **System Resets**: A function that automates resetting services or clearing caches.
     - **Health Checks**: A function that checks the health and status of specific services and components.
     - **Log Retrieval**: A function that fetches logs from services like CloudWatch and returns them to the developer for debugging.

3. **Permission and Security**
   - Ensure that Lambda functions are securely configured with:
     - **Least Privilege IAM roles** to limit access only to necessary resources (e.g., specific databases, logging services).
     - API Gateway integration or IAM authentication for triggering the Lambda functions securely.

4. **Integration and Triggering**
   - Set up API Gateway to allow developers to trigger these Lambda functions via HTTP endpoints, or integrate them with Slack, CLI tools, or internal dashboards for easier execution.
   - Define input parameters for each function to allow developers to customize their actions (e.g., specifying a date range for log retrieval).

5. **Testing**
   - Deploy the Lambda functions and test their behavior by:
     - Triggering data queries and ensuring correct results are returned.
     - Running system resets and verifying the expected outcomes.
     - Executing health checks to ensure all services are correctly monitored.
     - Retrieving logs and confirming that they are correctly fetched from the necessary resources.

6. **Monitoring and Logs**
   - Monitor the performance of Lambda functions via **CloudWatch** to ensure they run efficiently and log any issues or errors.
   - Set up alerts to notify the DevOps team if any Lambda function fails or exceeds resource limits.

### Testing
- Test the Lambda functions by simulating common developer tasks to ensure they work as expected.
- Verify that permissions are correctly set to prevent unauthorized access to infrastructure components.
- Ensure that all developer actions triggered via Lambda functions are logged and monitored in CloudWatch.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have deployed a set of Lambda functions to automate common developer actions.
- Should have tested that each Lambda function works correctly and provides expected results.
- Should have secured Lambda functions with appropriate permissions and access control.
- Should have set up monitoring and alerting to track the performance and health of the functions.
