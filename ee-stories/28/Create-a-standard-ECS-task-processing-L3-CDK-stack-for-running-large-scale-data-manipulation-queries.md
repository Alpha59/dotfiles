# Create a standard ECS task processing L3 CDK stack for running large scale data manipulation queries
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to create a standard ECS task processing L3 CDK stack for running large-scale data manipulation queries, **So That** data processing workloads can be efficiently executed in a scalable and reliable environment.

This story focuses on building a reusable CDK stack to set up an ECS service optimized for large-scale data processing, ensuring that it can handle high-volume queries with ease and scalability.

### Vision
The L3 CDK stack will provide a standardized way to create ECS tasks that process large datasets, ensuring best practices for scalability, performance, and fault tolerance. It will be reusable across multiple services, reducing the time needed to set up similar workloads.

### Background
Large-scale data manipulation often requires heavy processing power, which ECS is well-suited for. Automating the setup with CDK ensures consistency, reusability, and ease of deployment while optimizing for AWS services like Fargate for scalability.

## Details
1. **ECS Cluster Setup**
   - Define an ECS cluster using Fargate for serverless compute with auto-scaling.
   - Use **Spot Instances** to optimize cost for non-time-sensitive queries.

2. **Task Definition**
   - Configure a task definition with sufficient CPU, memory, and a robust retry mechanism.
   - Use environment variables for specifying data sources and query parameters.

3. **S3 and EFS Storage**
   - Integrate with **S3** for input/output data storage.
   - Optionally use **EFS** for large file access during processing.

4. **Networking and Security**
   - Set up networking (VPC, subnets) and attach appropriate security groups for access to data sources and services.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Configure **CloudWatch Logs** and **ECS metrics** for monitoring task health and performance.

### Testing
- Test the stack by deploying a sample ECS task that processes a large dataset, ensuring the task scales efficiently and completes without failures.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a CDK stack that sets up ECS tasks for data manipulation queries.
- Should support scaling based on workload size.
- Should integrate with S3 for data input/output.

By creating this ECS processing stack, we streamline the deployment of large-scale data processing tasks while ensuring that they are scalable and reliable.
