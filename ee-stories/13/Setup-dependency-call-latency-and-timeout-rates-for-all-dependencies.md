# Setup dependency call latency and timeout rates for all dependencies
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to set up monitoring for dependency call latency and timeout rates for all dependencies, **So That** we can track the performance of external and internal service calls, detect potential issues early, and maintain overall system health and responsiveness.

This story focuses on implementing a monitoring solution that captures and analyzes the latency and timeout rates of all service dependencies. By monitoring these metrics, we can proactively identify performance bottlenecks, ensure that dependencies meet required response times, and quickly respond to issues that may affect the systemâ€™s overall performance.

### Vision
By setting up dependency call latency and timeout rate monitoring, we aim to gain visibility into the performance of all dependencies, both internal and external. This enables us to detect anomalies and performance degradations promptly, allowing for proactive maintenance and optimization. Monitoring these metrics helps in ensuring that service level agreements (SLAs) are met and that the system remains responsive and reliable.

### Background
Currently, there may be limited visibility into the performance of dependency calls, leading to delayed detection of latency issues or timeouts that can negatively impact system performance and user experience. Setting up monitoring for these metrics is crucial for identifying and addressing potential problems early, reducing the risk of service degradation or failure.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement monitoring for dependency call latency and timeout rates, providing insights into the performance of all service dependencies. This initiative supports the goal of maintaining high system performance, minimizing user impact from degraded services, and ensuring that dependencies are performing within acceptable parameters.

## Details
1. **Identify Key Dependencies**:
    - Catalog all internal and external dependencies that the system relies on, including APIs, databases, third-party services, and internal microservices.
    - Define acceptable latency thresholds and timeout limits for each dependency based on their criticality and expected performance levels.

2. **Implement Monitoring for Latency and Timeouts**:
    - Use monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus) to track and record the latency and timeout rates of calls to each dependency.
    - Set up metrics collection and aggregation to monitor the average, 95th percentile, and maximum latency values, as well as the rate of timeouts for each dependency.

3. **Configure Alerts and Notifications**:
    - Define alert thresholds for latency and timeout rates, specifying when an alert should be triggered (e.g., latency exceeds a defined threshold for a sustained period).
    - Integrate with alerting tools (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) to notify the on-call team when latency or timeout rates breach the defined thresholds, enabling prompt investigation and resolution.

4. **Dashboard and Visualization**:
    - Create dashboards in the monitoring tool to visualize dependency call latency and timeout rates, providing real-time insights and historical trends.
    - Include key metrics and graphs that highlight the performance of each dependency, allowing for easy identification of patterns or anomalies.

5. **Regular Review and Optimization**:
    - Schedule regular reviews of the latency and timeout metrics to identify any recurring issues or trends that may require optimization or architectural changes.
    - Work with development teams to investigate and address any identified performance bottlenecks in dependency calls.

### Testing
- Simulate various dependency call scenarios, including high latency and timeouts, to validate that the monitoring and alerting setup correctly detects and reports these conditions.
- Test the alerting system to ensure that notifications are sent to the appropriate channels when latency or timeout thresholds are exceeded.
- Review the monitoring dashboards to confirm that they accurately reflect the current performance of all dependencies and provide actionable insights.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with monitoring and alerting tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to track dependency call latency and timeout rates.
- Collaboration with development teams to define acceptable performance thresholds for each dependency.
- Access to the codebase for implementing instrumentation if necessary to capture latency and timeout metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified all internal and external dependencies and defined acceptable latency and timeout thresholds for each.
- Should have implemented monitoring for dependency call latency and timeout rates using appropriate monitoring tools.
- Should have configured alerts to notify the on-call team when latency or timeout rates exceed defined thresholds.
- Should have created dashboards that visualize latency and timeout metrics for all dependencies, providing real-time and historical insights.
- Should have validated the monitoring setup through testing, ensuring accurate detection and reporting of latency and timeout issues.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Monitoring Dependency Call Latency
Given the implementation of latency monitoring for dependencies,
When a dependency call latency exceeds the defined threshold,
Then the monitoring system should detect the high latency and trigger an alert to notify the on-call team.

#### Scenario: Tracking Timeout Rates for Dependencies
Given the monitoring setup for dependency call timeouts,
When the timeout rate for a dependency exceeds the acceptable limit,
Then an alert should be triggered, and the incident should be logged for further investigation.

#### Scenario: Visualizing Dependency Performance
Given the setup of monitoring dashboards,
When the team reviews the dashboard,
Then they should see real-time and historical data on latency and timeout rates for all dependencies, enabling performance analysis and optimization.
