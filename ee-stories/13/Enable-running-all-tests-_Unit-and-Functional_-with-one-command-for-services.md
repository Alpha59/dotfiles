# Enable running all tests (Unit and Functional) with one command for services
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Engineer, **I want** to enable running all tests (unit and functional) with a single command, **So That** we can streamline the testing process, improve developer productivity, and ensure that all aspects of the application are thoroughly tested before deployment.

This story focuses on creating a unified command or script that triggers both unit and functional tests in the development environment. By consolidating the testing process into a single command, we aim to simplify the workflow, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistent execution of tests across the team.

### Vision
Providing a single command to run all tests makes it easier for developers to verify the correctness of their code before committing or deploying. This automation reduces the likelihood of skipping tests, encourages regular testing, and improves overall code quality. A streamlined testing process ensures that all necessary tests are run consistently, minimizing the risk of defects reaching production.

### Background
Currently, running unit and functional tests may require executing multiple commands or scripts, which can lead to inconsistencies in testing practices and increase the chances of overlooking tests. By combining these tests into a single command, we can ensure a more efficient and reliable testing process, enabling faster feedback and quicker iterations during development.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement a single command that runs all unit and functional tests, simplifying the testing process and ensuring comprehensive test coverage. This initiative aims to enhance developer productivity and maintain high code quality.

## Details
1. **Identify and Organize Tests**:
    - Review the current structure of unit and functional tests to identify their locations, naming conventions, and dependencies.
    - Organize the tests into a logical structure if necessary, ensuring that the testing framework can easily locate and execute them.

2. **Create a Unified Test Command**:
    - Develop a script (e.g., using a shell script, Makefile, or a task runner like npm for Node.js projects) that consolidates the commands needed to run both unit and functional tests.
    - Ensure that the script runs all tests in the correct order and captures the results in a unified format.

3. **Integrate with Testing Frameworks**:
    - Integrate the unified test command with existing testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Jest, pytest) to ensure compatibility and proper execution of all tests.
    - Include options for verbose output, test filtering, and parallel execution if supported by the frameworks to enhance the testing process.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Test the unified command in the development environment to ensure it correctly executes all unit and functional tests.
    - Validate that the command provides accurate feedback on test results, including summaries of passed, failed, and skipped tests.

5. **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**:
    - Document the unified test command, including how to execute it, available options, and expected outputs.
    - Provide guidelines for integrating the command into the development workflow, such as running tests before committing code or deploying to staging environments.

### Testing
- Execute the unified test command in different environments (e.g., local development, CI/CD pipeline) to ensure consistent behavior and compatibility.
- Verify that all unit and functional tests are executed and that their results are accurately reported.
- Simulate various scenarios, such as failing tests or missing dependencies, to confirm that the command handles errors gracefully and provides useful feedback.
- Ensure that the command can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines and supports automation for continuous testing.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the codebase and existing test suites for unit and functional tests.
- Integration with testing frameworks and tools (e.g., JUnit, Jest, pytest) used for running the tests.
- Collaboration with the development team to validate the unified test command and incorporate it into their workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have created a single command or script that executes all unit and functional tests in the project.
- Should have verified that the unified command runs all tests in the correct order and reports the results accurately.
- Should have documented the unified test command and provided usage guidelines for the development team.
- Should have validated the command through testing in various environments, ensuring it works consistently and supports automation.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Running All Tests with a Single Command
Given the implementation of a unified test command,
When the command is executed,
Then it should run all unit and functional tests and provide a summary of the results.

#### Scenario: Handling Test Failures
Given the unified test command,
When a test fails,
Then the command should display the failure details and exit with an appropriate status code indicating the failure.

#### Scenario: Integrating the Unified Command into CI/CD Pipeline
Given the integration of the unified test command into the CI/CD pipeline,
When the pipeline runs,
Then all tests should be executed as part of the build process, ensuring comprehensive test coverage before deployment.
