# Design Disaster Recovery strategy to prevent irrecoverable data loss
### Summary
**As a** Disaster Recovery Planner, **I want** to design a Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy to prevent irrecoverable data loss, **So That** we can ensure data integrity, maintain business continuity, and quickly recover from catastrophic events such as data corruption, system failures, or natural disasters.

This story focuses on creating a comprehensive DR strategy that includes backup and recovery plans, data replication, and failover mechanisms. The aim is to safeguard critical data, minimize downtime, and ensure that the organization can quickly restore operations in the event of a disaster.

### Vision
The DR strategy will establish robust safeguards against data loss by implementing multiple layers of data protection. This includes regular data backups, offsite storage, real-time data replication, and automated failover mechanisms. By having a well-defined DR strategy, the organization can quickly recover from disruptions, ensuring data availability and protecting against irrecoverable loss.

### Background
Currently, the absence of a structured DR strategy can lead to significant risks of data loss and extended downtime in the event of a disaster. Without proper backup, replication, and recovery procedures, the organization is vulnerable to losing critical data, which can result in operational setbacks, financial loss, and damage to reputation. Implementing a DR strategy is essential for ensuring data resilience and business continuity.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to design a DR strategy that includes measures to prevent irrecoverable data loss, including backup and recovery processes, data replication, and automated failover mechanisms. This initiative aims to protect critical data, minimize downtime, and ensure a rapid recovery from any disaster scenario.

## Details
1. **Assess Data and System Requirements**:
    - Identify and categorize critical data assets and systems, prioritizing those that are essential for business operations.
    - Determine Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) for each data category to define acceptable data loss and recovery timeframes.

2. **Implement Data Backup and Recovery**:
    - Set up regular, automated backups of critical data to a secure, geographically separated location, ensuring that backups are protected from local failures or disasters.
    - Use incremental and full backup strategies to optimize storage and ensure data is recoverable to specific points in time.
    - Test backup and recovery procedures regularly to ensure that data can be restored quickly and accurately in the event of a disaster.

3. **Data Replication and Redundancy**:
    - Implement real-time or near-real-time data replication to secondary sites or cloud storage to ensure high availability and data redundancy.
    - Use technologies like AWS RDS Multi-AZ,  S3 Cross-Region Replication, or database clustering to maintain synchronized copies of critical data across multiple locations.
    - Configure automated failover mechanisms to switch to the secondary site in case of primary site failure.

4. **Automated Failover and Recovery**:
    - Design and implement automated failover procedures to redirect traffic and workloads to a backup site or system during an outage.
    - Ensure failover mechanisms are tested and validated to function correctly without manual intervention, minimizing recovery time.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - Integrate monitoring tools to continuously track the health of primary and backup systems, as well as data replication processes.
    - Set up alerts for any anomalies or failures in backup, replication, or failover processes to enable immediate response and remediation.

6. **Documentation and Testing**:
    - Document the entire DR strategy, including backup schedules, replication processes, failover procedures, and recovery steps.
    - Conduct regular DR drills and testing to validate the effectiveness of the strategy, identify potential gaps, and ensure that all team members are familiar with their roles in the recovery process.

### Testing
- Perform DR drills simulating various disaster scenarios (e.g., data corruption, system failure, regional outage) to ensure the strategy's effectiveness.
- Test the backup and recovery process by restoring data from backups to verify integrity and completeness.
- Validate the data replication setup by simulating a primary site failure and verifying that the failover to the secondary site occurs correctly.
- Review monitoring and alerting systems to ensure they detect and notify of any issues in real-time, enabling prompt response.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with backup and replication tools (e.g., AWS Backup,  S3, RDS Multi-AZ).
- Access to cloud storage or secondary data centers for data replication and failover.
- Collaboration with IT and operations teams to define RPOs, RTOs, and execute DR testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and categorized critical data assets and defined RPOs and RTOs for each category.
- Should have implemented a regular, automated backup process with secure offsite storage and validated recovery procedures.
- Should have set up real-time or near-real-time data replication to secondary locations or cloud storage, ensuring data redundancy.
- Should have implemented automated failover mechanisms to redirect operations in the event of a primary site failure.
- Should have documented the DR strategy and conducted regular testing to ensure its effectiveness and readiness for actual disaster scenarios.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Data Backup and Recovery
Given the implementation of automated data backups,
When a backup is taken,
Then the data should be securely stored offsite and be recoverable to a specific point in time.

#### Scenario: Data Replication and Failover
Given the setup of real-time data replication,
When the primary site fails,
Then the system should automatically failover to the secondary site, maintaining data availability and integrity.

#### Scenario: Testing the DR Strategy
Given the need to ensure DR strategy effectiveness,
When a DR drill is conducted,
Then the team should be able to restore data, validate failover processes, and resume operations within the defined RTO.
