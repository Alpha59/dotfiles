# Document and implement automated rollback mechanism from Sev-2 Alarms
### Summary
**As a** Reliable Engineer, **I want** to document and implement an automated rollback mechanism triggered by Severity 2 (Sev-2) alarms, **So That** we can quickly revert to a stable state when critical issues arise, minimizing customer impact and ensuring service reliability.

This story focuses on creating a process for automatically rolling back deployments in response to Sev-2 alarms. By implementing this automated rollback mechanism, we aim to reduce downtime and mitigate the impact of critical incidents by quickly restoring the system to a known good state.

### Vision
An automated rollback mechanism allows for rapid response to Sev-2 incidents, where the system can automatically revert to a previous stable deployment upon detecting significant issues. This reduces the manual intervention required during critical outages, speeds up recovery time, and minimizes disruption to customers. Documenting the process ensures that the rollback mechanism is well-understood and can be managed effectively by the team.

### Background
Currently, the process for rolling back deployments in response to Sev-2 alarms may involve manual intervention, leading to delays in resolving critical incidents and increasing the risk of extended downtime. Automating this process will ensure a quicker and more reliable response to incidents, enhancing the system's overall resilience and customer experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement an automated rollback mechanism that is triggered by Sev-2 alarms, providing a faster recovery option for critical incidents. This initiative supports the broader goal of maintaining high service availability and minimizing customer impact during outages.

## Details
1. **Define Rollback Criteria and Triggers**:
    - Identify the specific conditions under which a Sev-2 alarm should trigger an automated rollback, such as sustained error rates, increased latency, or significant degradation in service performance.
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to establish the thresholds and metrics that will be used to determine when a rollback is necessary.

2. **Implement Automated Rollback Mechanism**:
    - Use AWS CloudFormation, AWS CodePipeline, or other deployment tools to implement an automated rollback process that reverts the system to the last known stable state upon triggering.
    - Ensure that the rollback process is integrated with the existing CI/CD pipeline and can be initiated without manual intervention.

3. **Integrate with Monitoring and Alarms**:
    - Configure Sev-2 alarms to automatically trigger the rollback mechanism when the defined conditions are met.
    - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Datadog) to continuously monitor the system and detect incidents that require rollback.

4. **Documentation and Testing**:
    - Document the automated rollback process, including the criteria, steps involved, and how the mechanism integrates with the CI/CD pipeline and monitoring tools.
    - Develop test cases to simulate Sev-2 incidents and validate that the rollback mechanism is correctly triggered and executed.

5. **Notification and Reporting**:
    - Configure the rollback mechanism to send notifications to the on-call team and relevant stakeholders when a rollback is initiated, including details of the incident and the rollback status.
    - Implement logging and reporting to capture information about each rollback event for post-incident analysis and review.

### Testing
- Perform end-to-end testing of the automated rollback mechanism by simulating various Sev-2 scenarios to ensure the rollback is triggered and executed correctly.
- Validate the rollback process to confirm that the system reverts to the last known stable state without introducing additional issues.
- Test the integration with monitoring and alarm systems to ensure that triggers are accurate and that the rollback occurs within the expected time frame.
- Review logs and notifications to verify that rollback events are correctly documented and communicated to the team.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the CI/CD environment and deployment tools for implementing the rollback mechanism.
- Integration with monitoring and alerting tools to detect and respond to Sev-2 incidents.
- Collaboration with development, operations, and incident response teams to define rollback criteria and test the process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have defined and documented the criteria and conditions under which a Sev-2 alarm will trigger an automated rollback.
- Should have implemented an automated rollback mechanism integrated with the CI/CD pipeline to revert to a stable state upon detecting Sev-2 incidents.
- Should have integrated the rollback mechanism with monitoring and alarm systems to enable automatic triggering and execution.
- Should have validated the rollback process through testing to ensure it functions correctly and effectively minimizes customer impact.
- Should have configured notifications and reporting to inform the team of rollback events and provide details for post-incident analysis.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Automated Rollback Triggered by Sev-2 Alarm
Given the presence of a Sev-2 alarm indicating critical service degradation,
When the alarm meets the defined rollback criteria,
Then the automated rollback mechanism should trigger and revert the system to the last known stable state.

#### Scenario: Successful Execution of Automated Rollback
Given the initiation of an automated rollback,
When the rollback process is executed,
Then the system should return to the last stable deployment without introducing additional issues.

#### Scenario: Notification of Rollback Events
Given the automated rollback mechanism,
When a rollback is triggered,
Then a notification should be sent to the on-call team and stakeholders, including details of the incident and the rollback status.
