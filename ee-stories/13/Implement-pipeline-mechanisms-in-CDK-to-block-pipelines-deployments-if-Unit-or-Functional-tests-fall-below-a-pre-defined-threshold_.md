# Implement pipeline mechanisms in CDK to block pipelines deployments if Unit or Functional tests fall below a pre-defined threshold.
### Summary
**As an** Engineer, **I want** to implement pipeline mechanisms in AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to block pipeline deployments if unit or functional tests fall below a pre-defined threshold, **So That** we can ensure only high-quality code is deployed, reducing the risk of introducing defects into production.

This story focuses on enhancing the Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline by integrating mechanisms to enforce quality gates based on test coverage and test pass rates. By implementing this control, we ensure that code with insufficient test coverage or failed tests does not progress through the pipeline, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the software.

### Vision
By integrating quality gates into the CD pipeline using AWS CDK, we aim to automate the enforcement of testing standards. This will prevent code with inadequate test coverage or failing tests from being deployed, ensuring that only thoroughly tested and reliable code reaches production. This mechanism improves the overall quality of the software and reduces the likelihood of post-deployment issues.

### Background
Currently, the deployment process may allow code changes to progress through the pipeline even if they have insufficient test coverage or fail certain tests. This can lead to defects being introduced into the production environment, increasing the risk of system instability and negatively impacting user experience. Implementing automated quality gates based on test results will strengthen the pipeline's ability to maintain high standards of software quality.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement mechanisms within the CDK pipeline to automatically block deployments when unit or functional test results fall below a defined threshold. This will ensure that only code that meets the required quality standards is deployed, supporting the broader goal of delivering reliable and high-quality software.

## Details
1. **Define Testing Thresholds**:
    - Set pre-defined thresholds for unit and functional test coverage (e.g., a minimum of 80% coverage) and test pass rates (e.g., 100% pass rate required).
    - Document the thresholds and communicate them to the development team to ensure alignment and understanding.

2. **Configure Pipeline Mechanisms in CDK**:
    - Update the CDK pipeline definition to include stages for running unit and functional tests as part of the build process.
    - Integrate test coverage tools (e.g., Jest, JUnit, or other testing frameworks) into the pipeline to measure and report on code coverage and test results.

3. **Implement Quality Gates**:
    - Add conditional checks within the CDK pipeline to evaluate test coverage and pass rates against the defined thresholds.
    - Block the deployment stage if the test results do not meet the specified criteria, preventing the pipeline from progressing.

4. **Notification and Reporting**:
    - Configure notifications to alert the development team when a deployment is blocked due to failing to meet test thresholds.
    - Include detailed reports on test coverage and failures to provide insights into areas that need attention before the code can be deployed.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Test the pipeline modifications by simulating scenarios where test coverage and pass rates fall below the threshold to ensure the deployment is correctly blocked.
    - Validate that the quality gates do not introduce unnecessary delays or false positives in the pipeline, maintaining an efficient CI/CD process.

### Testing
- Perform integration testing of the CDK pipeline to ensure it correctly integrates with test coverage tools and reports accurate test results.
- Simulate various test scenarios to validate that the pipeline blocks deployments when the thresholds are not met and allows them when they are.
- Test the notification system to ensure that alerts are sent to the appropriate channels when a deployment is blocked due to failing quality gates.
- Review the end-to-end pipeline process to ensure that the quality gates are effective and do not interfere with the normal CI/CD workflow.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with test coverage tools and frameworks to collect and report test metrics.
- Access to the CI/CD environment and CDK pipeline configurations for modification and testing.
- Collaboration with the development team to define appropriate test thresholds and ensure compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have pre-defined thresholds for unit and functional test coverage and pass rates documented and communicated to the team.
- Should have integrated the CDK pipeline with test coverage tools and implemented quality gates to block deployments based on test results.
- Should have configured notifications and reporting to alert the team when deployments are blocked due to insufficient test results.
- Should have validated the pipeline modifications through testing to ensure they function as intended without hindering the CI/CD process.
- Should have successfully blocked deployments during testing scenarios where test thresholds were not met, confirming the effectiveness of the quality gates.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Blocking Deployment Due to Insufficient Test Coverage
Given a code change with unit and functional test coverage below the defined threshold,
When the CDK pipeline runs,
Then the deployment should be blocked, and a notification should be sent to the development team.

#### Scenario: Allowing Deployment with Sufficient Test Coverage
Given a code change with unit and functional test coverage meeting or exceeding the defined threshold,
When the CDK pipeline runs,
Then the deployment should proceed to the next stage without being blocked.

#### Scenario: Reporting Test Results and Blocking Notifications
Given a deployment is blocked due to failing to meet the test thresholds,
When the pipeline notifies the team,
Then the notification should include detailed information on test coverage and failure points for review.
