# Develop recovery strategy for data, application, and infrastructure
### Summary
**As a** Disaster Recovery Planner, **I want** to develop a recovery strategy for data, applications, and infrastructure, **So That** we can quickly restore operations in the event of a disaster, minimize downtime, and ensure business continuity and data integrity.

This story focuses on creating a comprehensive recovery strategy that addresses the restoration of critical data, applications, and infrastructure components. The strategy will include backup and recovery procedures, failover mechanisms, and infrastructure restoration processes to ensure that the organization can swiftly recover from disruptions and maintain operational resilience.

### Vision
A well-defined recovery strategy provides a structured approach to restoring data, applications, and infrastructure in the event of a disaster. This strategy aims to minimize downtime, data loss, and the impact on business operations by ensuring that all essential components can be quickly and reliably recovered. By implementing this strategy, we enhance the organization's ability to maintain continuity and safeguard against various disaster scenarios.

### Background
Currently, the absence of a comprehensive recovery strategy can lead to extended downtime, data loss, and operational disruptions during a disaster. Without a clear plan for recovering data, applications, and infrastructure, the organization is vulnerable to prolonged outages and potential loss of critical information. Developing a recovery strategy is crucial to ensuring a swift and effective response to disasters.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to develop a recovery strategy for data, applications, and infrastructure, ensuring that we can restore operations quickly and effectively in the event of a disaster. This initiative aims to reduce downtime, protect data integrity, and maintain business continuity.

## Details
1. **Assess and Prioritize Assets**:
    - Identify and categorize critical data, applications, and infrastructure components that are essential for business operations.
    - Determine Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) for each asset to define acceptable data loss and recovery timeframes.
    - Prioritize assets based on their importance to the organization and the impact of their unavailability.

2. **Develop Data Recovery Procedures**:
    - Implement regular, automated data backups to secure locations, using a combination of full, incremental, and differential backups to ensure data is recoverable.
    - Establish procedures for data restoration, including full and partial recoveries, and point-in-time recovery for databases.
    - Test data recovery procedures regularly to ensure they work as expected and meet the defined RPOs and RTOs.

3. **Establish Application Recovery Process**:
    - Develop application recovery procedures, including steps for restoring application servers, configurations, and dependencies.
    - Implement automated failover mechanisms for critical applications to ensure high availability and minimize downtime.
    - Use containerization or virtualization technologies to facilitate rapid recovery and deployment of applications in a new environment.

4. **Infrastructure Recovery and Restoration**:
    - Document the infrastructure architecture, including network topology, server configurations, storage, and security settings.
    - Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) practices to automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure components, allowing for rapid restoration in the event of a disaster.
    - Develop procedures for restoring infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, network settings, and load balancers, in a new or existing environment.

5. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect failures, performance degradation, and security incidents in real-time, enabling prompt response and recovery.
    - Include automated health checks and validation steps as part of the recovery process to ensure that restored components are functioning correctly.

6. **Documentation and Testing**:
    - Document the entire recovery strategy, including detailed procedures for data, application, and infrastructure recovery.
    - Conduct regular disaster recovery drills and tests to validate the effectiveness of the recovery strategy and ensure that the team is familiar with the procedures.
    - Review and update the recovery strategy periodically to reflect changes in the environment, applications, or business requirements.

### Testing
- Perform end-to-end recovery tests for data, applications, and infrastructure in a non-production environment to ensure that the recovery procedures work as intended.
- Simulate various disaster scenarios, such as data corruption, application failure, and infrastructure outages, to validate the recovery strategy's effectiveness.
- Monitor the recovery process to identify any bottlenecks or issues and make improvements as needed.
- Review test results with stakeholders to ensure that the recovery strategy meets the defined RPOs and RTOs.

### External Dependencies
- Access to backup and recovery tools for data and applications, such as AWS Backup, AWS RDS, and Elastic Load Balancing.
- Integration with monitoring and alerting tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to detect and respond to incidents in real-time.
- Collaboration with the infrastructure, application, and data teams to define recovery requirements and validate the recovery strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have developed detailed recovery procedures for data, applications, and infrastructure, including backup and restoration processes.
- Should have implemented automated backup and failover mechanisms to support rapid recovery and high availability.
- Should have tested the recovery strategy through simulated disaster scenarios to validate its effectiveness and compliance with RPOs and RTOs.
- Should have documented the recovery strategy and conducted training and drills to ensure the team is prepared to execute the recovery process.
- Should have implemented monitoring and alerting systems to detect incidents and support the recovery process.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Recovering from Data Loss
Given the implementation of data backup and recovery procedures,
When data loss occurs,
Then the recovery process should restore the data to the last available backup, meeting the defined RPOs and RTOs.

#### Scenario: Application Failover and Recovery
Given the setup of application failover mechanisms,
When an application failure is detected,
Then the system should automatically failover to a secondary instance, minimizing downtime and maintaining availability.

#### Scenario: Infrastructure Restoration
Given the documentation of infrastructure components,
When an infrastructure outage occurs,
Then the recovery process should restore the necessary infrastructure using IaC practices, ensuring a quick and consistent recovery.
