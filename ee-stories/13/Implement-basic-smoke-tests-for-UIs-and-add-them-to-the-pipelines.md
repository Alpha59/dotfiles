# Implement basic smoke tests for UIs and add them to the pipelines
### Summary
**As a** Quality Assurance Engineer, **I want** to implement basic smoke tests for user interfaces (UIs) and integrate them into the CI/CD pipelines, **So That** we can ensure the core functionality of the application is intact after each deployment, detect critical issues early, and maintain a reliable user experience.

This story focuses on creating automated smoke tests that verify the essential functionality of the application's UI. By integrating these tests into the CI/CD pipeline, we aim to quickly identify any major issues that could affect the application's usability, allowing for immediate remediation before changes reach production.

### Vision
Implementing smoke tests for UIs and adding them to the pipeline provides an initial layer of testing to catch high-level issues early in the deployment process. This practice helps to ensure that the application's critical UI components are functioning correctly after every code change, reducing the risk of deploying faulty code and improving overall software quality.

### Background
Currently, UI issues may go undetected until later stages of the deployment process, increasing the risk of releasing broken or unusable interfaces to end-users. By adding smoke tests to the pipeline, we can quickly verify that the core functionality of the UI is operational after each build, enabling faster feedback and reducing the potential impact of defects on the user experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement basic smoke tests for the UI components of the application and integrate them into the CI/CD pipelines. This initiative aims to provide quick verification of the UI's core functionality, ensuring that any critical issues are detected and addressed early in the deployment process.

## Details
1. **Identify Critical UI Components**:
    - Collaborate with the product and development teams to identify the key UI components and user flows that need to be included in the smoke tests.
    - Focus on the core functionality that is critical to the application's operation, such as login, navigation, form submissions, and key user interactions.

2. **Develop Automated Smoke Tests**:
    - Use a UI testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Puppeteer) to create automated smoke tests that verify the functionality of the identified components.
    - Write tests that perform basic actions, such as navigating to a page, interacting with elements (e.g., buttons, forms), and verifying that expected outcomes occur (e.g., correct page load, success messages).

3. **Integrate Smoke Tests into CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Add the smoke tests to the CI/CD pipeline, configuring them to run automatically after each build or deployment.
    - Ensure that the pipeline is configured to fail and alert the team if any smoke tests do not pass, providing immediate feedback on potential issues.

4. **Optimize Test Execution**:
    - Ensure that the smoke tests are lightweight and execute quickly to provide rapid feedback without significantly impacting the pipeline's overall duration.
    - Consider running smoke tests in parallel to reduce execution time and improve efficiency.

5. **Documentation and Maintenance**:
    - Document the smoke tests, including the purpose of each test, the expected outcomes, and instructions for running the tests locally if needed.
    - Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the smoke tests to reflect changes in the UI and maintain their relevance.

### Testing
- Execute the smoke tests manually in a development environment to ensure they correctly validate the functionality of the UI components.
- Test the integration of smoke tests into the CI/CD pipeline to verify that they run automatically after each deployment and provide immediate feedback on the test results.
- Simulate scenarios where the UI is intentionally broken or altered to confirm that the smoke tests correctly detect and report the issues.
- Monitor the performance and execution time of the smoke tests in the pipeline to ensure they provide timely feedback without causing delays.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the UI codebase and a testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress) for creating and executing automated smoke tests.
- Integration with the CI/CD pipeline to add and manage the execution of smoke tests.
- Collaboration with the product and development teams to identify critical UI components and validate the smoke tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified the critical UI components and user flows that need to be included in the smoke tests.
- Should have developed automated smoke tests using a UI testing framework to verify the core functionality of the application's UI.
- Should have integrated the smoke tests into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring they run automatically after each build or deployment.
- Should have validated that the smoke tests detect and report any critical issues in the UI, providing immediate feedback to the team.
- Should have documented the smoke tests and established a process for maintaining and updating them as needed.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Executing Smoke Tests for Critical UI Components
Given the implementation of automated smoke tests,
When a new build is deployed,
Then the smoke tests should run automatically and verify the core functionality of the UI components.

#### Scenario: Detecting UI Issues with Smoke Tests
Given the integration of smoke tests into the CI/CD pipeline,
When a critical UI component is broken,
Then the smoke tests should fail and alert the team, preventing the deployment of faulty code to production.

#### Scenario: Maintaining and Updating Smoke Tests
Given the documentation and implementation of smoke tests,
When changes are made to the UI,
Then the smoke tests should be reviewed and updated to reflect the changes, ensuring they remain relevant and effective.
