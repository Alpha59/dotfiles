# Document incorrect practices in exception handling and create stories to correct to standard exception handling
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Manager, **I want** to document incorrect practices in exception handling and create stories to correct them to standard exception handling practices, **So That** we can improve code quality, maintainability, and system reliability.

This story focuses on identifying and documenting improper exception handling practices within the codebase, such as unhandled exceptions, overly broad catch blocks, and inadequate error logging. The goal is to create corrective stories that adhere to standard exception handling guidelines, ensuring that exceptions are managed consistently and effectively.

### Vision
Correcting improper exception handling practices will lead to more maintainable, robust, and predictable code. Proper exception handling ensures that errors are caught and managed gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to users, preserving system stability, and aiding in the debugging process. By documenting current deficiencies and creating a plan to address them, we aim to standardize how exceptions are handled across the system.

### Background
Improper exception handling, such as swallowing exceptions without logging, using overly broad catch statements, or failing to handle exceptions entirely, can lead to hard-to-debug issues, degraded user experiences, and potential system failures. Addressing these issues by adopting standard exception handling practices is critical for building reliable software that can gracefully handle unexpected situations.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to document current improper exception handling practices and create corrective stories to standardize exception handling across the codebase. This initiative will enhance error detection, improve system reliability, and ensure that exceptions are handled in a manner consistent with best practices.

## Details
1. **Identify Improper Exception Handling Practices**:
    - Conduct a code review to identify instances of improper exception handling, such as unhandled exceptions, overly broad catch blocks (e.g., catching generic exceptions), and silent failures without logging.
    - Collaborate with the development team to identify any recurring patterns or known issues related to exception handling.

2. **Document Incorrect Practices**:
    - Document each identified instance of improper exception handling, including the file, method, and line number where it occurs.
    - Describe the specific issue with the current implementation, explaining why it is considered improper or suboptimal.
    - Provide examples of the incorrect practices to illustrate the issues.

3. **Define Standard Exception Handling Guidelines**:
    - Establish standard practices for exception handling, including guidelines on when to catch exceptions, how to log errors, and how to propagate exceptions appropriately.
    - Include recommendations on using specific exception types, avoiding overly broad catch blocks, and ensuring that meaningful error messages are logged.

4. **Create Stories to Correct Improper Practices**:
    - Create individual stories to address each identified instance of improper exception handling, outlining the necessary changes to conform to the established standards.
    - Include detailed acceptance criteria for each story to ensure that the corrections are implemented correctly and consistently.
    - Prioritize the stories based on the severity of the issues and their potential impact on system reliability.

### Testing
- Develop test cases to validate that the corrected exception handling properly catches and logs errors without impacting system performance.
- Perform code reviews to ensure that the changes conform to the standard exception handling guidelines and do not introduce new issues.
- Conduct integration testing to verify that the updated exception handling works as expected within the context of the entire application.
- Monitor logs after deploying the changes to ensure that exceptions are being captured and reported correctly.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the codebase and the ability to perform code reviews to identify improper exception handling practices.
- Collaboration with the development team to define standard exception handling guidelines and to implement the corrective stories.
- Tools for logging and monitoring to verify the effectiveness of the updated exception handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have documented all identified instances of improper exception handling, including descriptions of the issues and their locations in the codebase.
- Should have defined standard exception handling guidelines to provide a consistent approach to managing exceptions.
- Should have created individual corrective stories with detailed acceptance criteria for each identified issue.
- Should have validated the corrections through code reviews, testing, and monitoring to ensure they adhere to the standard guidelines and improve system reliability.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Identifying Improper Exception Handling
Given the need to improve exception handling,
When a code review is conducted,
Then instances of improper exception handling should be identified and documented, including the specific issues and their locations.

#### Scenario: Correcting Improper Exception Handling
Given the creation of corrective stories,
When the identified issues are addressed,
Then the exception handling should conform to the standard guidelines, improving error management and system reliability.

#### Scenario: Verifying Corrected Exception Handling
Given the implementation of the corrected exception handling,
When the code is tested and reviewed,
Then the system should correctly catch, log, and manage exceptions without impacting performance or user experience.
