# Evaluate and restrict access and permissions for production portals and websites
### Summary
**As a** Security and Compliance Engineer, **I want** to evaluate and restrict access and permissions for production portals and websites, **So That** we can enhance security, minimize the risk of unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with data protection policies.

This story focuses on reviewing current access permissions for production environments, identifying unnecessary or overly permissive access, and implementing restrictions to ensure that only authorized personnel have access. This initiative aims to strengthen the security posture of production systems and protect sensitive data.

### Vision
Restricting access and permissions for production portals and websites is crucial for maintaining system security and protecting sensitive information. By implementing the principle of least privilege, we can minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential security incidents. This process involves carefully evaluating current access controls and making necessary adjustments to ensure that only those with a legitimate need can access production resources.

### Background
Currently, access to production portals and websites may not be adequately restricted, potentially allowing unauthorized or unnecessary access. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, including the risk of data leaks, malicious activity, or inadvertent changes to production systems. Implementing stricter access controls and permissions is essential to maintaining the integrity and security of production environments.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to evaluate current access permissions for production portals and websites, identify and address any security gaps, and enforce a policy of least privilege. This initiative supports the broader goal of enhancing system security, ensuring compliance with data protection policies, and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to production systems.

## Details
1. **Evaluate Current Access and Permissions**:
    - Conduct a thorough review of existing access permissions for production portals and websites, identifying all users and roles with current access.
    - Analyze each user's access level and permissions to determine whether they align with their job responsibilities and operational needs.

2. **Identify Unnecessary or Overly Permissive Access**:
    - Identify instances where users have unnecessary or overly broad permissions that exceed what is required for their role.
    - Collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as team leads and security officers, to validate access requirements and identify users who no longer need access.

3. **Implement Access Restrictions**:
    - Modify access controls to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
    - Remove access for users who no longer require it or whose roles have changed, and restrict permissions for roles that currently have excessive access.

4. **Establish Access Management Policies**:
    - Define and document access management policies for production environments, including guidelines for requesting, granting, and revoking access.
    - Implement a process for regular review and auditing of access permissions to ensure ongoing compliance with the principle of least privilege.

5. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
    - Set up monitoring and logging to track access to production portals and websites, capturing details of user activities for auditing purposes.
    - Schedule regular access reviews to detect and respond to any unauthorized or suspicious access attempts promptly.

### Testing
- Validate the updated access controls by performing access tests to ensure that only authorized users can access production portals and websites.
- Conduct role-based access verification to confirm that users have the appropriate level of permissions based on their job functions.
- Test the process for requesting and revoking access to ensure that it is efficient and aligns with the new access management policies.
- Review audit logs and monitoring data to verify that access restrictions are being enforced and that there are no unauthorized access attempts.

### External Dependencies
- Access to user and role management tools for modifying and auditing access permissions.
- Collaboration with team leads, security officers, and other stakeholders to validate access requirements and implement changes.
- Integration with monitoring and logging systems to track access activities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have conducted a comprehensive review of existing access permissions for production portals and websites.
- Should have identified and addressed instances of unnecessary or overly permissive access, implementing the principle of least privilege.
- Should have established and documented access management policies for requesting, granting, and revoking access to production environments.
- Should have implemented monitoring and auditing to track access activities and ensure ongoing compliance with access restrictions.
- Should have validated the effectiveness of access restrictions through testing and regular reviews.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Evaluating and Restricting Access to Production Portals
Given the need to enhance security for production environments,
When access permissions are evaluated,
Then unnecessary or overly permissive access should be identified and restricted to enforce the principle of least privilege.

#### Scenario: Implementing Access Management Policies
Given the establishment of access management policies,
When a user requests access to a production portal,
Then the request should be evaluated based on the new policies, ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted.

#### Scenario: Monitoring and Auditing Access
Given the implementation of access restrictions,
When a user accesses a production portal,
Then the activity should be logged and monitored to detect any unauthorized or suspicious behavior.
