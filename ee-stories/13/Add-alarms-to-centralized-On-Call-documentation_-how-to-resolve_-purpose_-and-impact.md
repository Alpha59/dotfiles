# Add alarms to centralized On-Call documentation, how to resolve, purpose, and impact
### Summary
**As a** Reliable Engineer, **I want** to add alarms to the centralized On-Call documentation, including information on how to resolve them, their purpose, and their impact, **So That** on-call engineers can quickly and effectively address issues, minimizing downtime and ensuring service reliability.

This story aims to enhance the centralized On-Call documentation by including detailed information about each alarm. By documenting the resolution steps, purpose, and impact of alarms, we provide on-call engineers with the necessary resources to respond to incidents promptly and accurately.

### Vision
Including alarms in the centralized On-Call documentation will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of incident response by providing clear guidance on how to resolve issues. This comprehensive documentation helps on-call engineers understand the significance of each alarm, prioritize responses based on impact, and follow standardized resolution procedures, leading to quicker incident resolution and reduced downtime.

### Background
Currently, the lack of detailed documentation for alarms can result in slower incident response times, as on-call engineers may need to spend additional time identifying the root cause and determining the appropriate resolution steps. By documenting alarms, their resolution procedures, purpose, and impact, we can streamline the incident response process and reduce the risk of prolonged service disruptions.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to enhance the centralized On-Call documentation by including detailed information about each alarm, providing on-call engineers with the necessary knowledge to resolve incidents quickly and efficiently. This initiative supports the broader goal of maintaining high service availability and minimizing customer impact during incidents.

## Details
1. **Identify and Categorize Alarms**:
    - Compile a comprehensive list of all existing alarms, categorizing them based on severity (e.g., Sev-1, Sev-2), impacted services, and typical causes.
    - Collaborate with the development and operations teams to validate the list and ensure completeness.

2. **Document Resolution Steps**:
    - For each alarm, document the step-by-step procedure for investigating and resolving the issue, including any diagnostic commands, tools, or scripts that may be needed.
    - Include common troubleshooting tips, potential workarounds, and instructions for verifying that the issue has been resolved.

3. **Define Purpose and Impact**:
    - Document the purpose of each alarm, explaining what it monitors and why it is important for system health and reliability.
    - Describe the potential impact of the alarm on the system and customers, including possible consequences if the issue is not resolved promptly.

4. **Integrate with Centralized On-Call Documentation**:
    - Organize the alarm documentation within the centralized On-Call guide, ensuring that it is easily accessible and logically structured for quick reference.
    - Use a standardized format for each alarm entry, including sections for resolution steps, purpose, and impact.

5. **Review and Update**:
    - Conduct a review of the updated documentation with the on-call team to ensure clarity and completeness.
    - Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the alarm documentation to reflect changes in the system or incident response procedures.

### Testing
- Validate the documentation by having on-call engineers use it to resolve simulated alarms, ensuring that the steps provided are accurate and effective.
- Review feedback from the on-call team to identify any gaps or areas for improvement in the documentation.
- Test the accessibility of the documentation within the centralized On-Call guide to ensure that it is easily navigable during an incident.

### External Dependencies
- Collaboration with development and operations teams to gather information on alarms and resolution procedures.
- Access to the centralized On-Call documentation platform for adding and organizing alarm information.
- Regular input from the on-call team to review and improve the documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have documented resolution steps, purpose, and impact for all identified alarms in the centralized On-Call guide.
- Should have organized the alarm documentation in a clear and accessible manner within the On-Call guide.
- Should have validated the accuracy and effectiveness of the documentation through testing and feedback from the on-call team.
- Should have established a process for regularly reviewing and updating the alarm documentation.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Accessing Alarm Documentation During an Incident
Given an active alarm in the system,
When the on-call engineer refers to the centralized On-Call documentation,
Then they should find detailed information on the alarm, including resolution steps, purpose, and impact.

#### Scenario: Using Documentation to Resolve an Alarm
Given the detailed resolution steps in the documentation,
When the on-call engineer follows the instructions,
Then they should be able to resolve the alarm efficiently and verify the resolution.

#### Scenario: Reviewing and Updating Alarm Documentation
Given changes in the system or incident response procedures,
When the documentation is reviewed,
Then it should be updated to reflect the current state and best practices for resolving alarms.
