# Disambiguate metrics from feature flag enabled functionality and existing production applications
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to disambiguate metrics between feature-flag-enabled functionality and existing production applications, **So That** we can accurately assess the impact of new features on performance and user experience without conflating them with metrics from the existing system.

This story focuses on distinguishing and separately tracking metrics for new functionality enabled by feature flags from those of the existing production applications. This separation allows for clearer analysis and better decision-making regarding the performance and success of new features.

### Vision
By disambiguating metrics between feature-flag-enabled functionality and existing production applications, we can gain precise insights into how new features perform in isolation. This enables us to identify any issues or performance impacts introduced by the new functionality and make data-driven decisions about feature rollouts. This approach helps in maintaining overall system performance and improving the success rate of new features.

### Background
Currently, metrics from new features enabled by feature flags may be mixed with metrics from the existing production system, making it difficult to isolate the performance and impact of these new features. This conflation can obscure understanding of how new functionality affects system performance and user experience, hindering effective analysis and optimization.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement mechanisms to separate and track metrics for feature-flag-enabled functionality independently from existing production applications. This initiative allows for accurate assessment of the performance and impact of new features, supporting more informed decision-making regarding their rollout and optimization.

## Details
1. **Identify Metrics for Feature-Flagged Functionality**:
    - Collaborate with product managers and developers to identify the specific metrics that need to be tracked for each feature-flag-enabled functionality.
    - Determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) and user interaction metrics that will help assess the featureâ€™s impact.

2. **Implement Tagging and Segregation of Metrics**:
    - Modify the instrumentation and monitoring setup to include tags or labels that differentiate metrics for feature-flagged functionality from those of the existing production application.
    - Implement conditional logging or metric collection based on the state of the feature flag to ensure that only relevant data is captured for each scenario.

3. **Configure Monitoring Tools**:
    - Update the monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to recognize and segregate the metrics based on the tags or labels applied.
    - Create separate dashboards and visualizations for feature-flag-enabled functionality and existing production applications to allow for independent analysis.

4. **Alerting and Analysis**:
    - Configure alerts to be context-sensitive, ensuring that alerts for new features are triggered and managed separately from those of the existing system.
    - Analyze the metrics for feature-flagged functionality independently to identify any performance impacts, user behavior changes, or anomalies introduced by the new feature.

5. **Documentation and Review**:
    - Document the changes made to the monitoring setup, including how metrics are tagged and segregated.
    - Regularly review the segregated metrics to ensure that the tracking accurately reflects the performance of both new and existing functionality, making adjustments as necessary.

### Testing
- Validate that the monitoring setup correctly differentiates and segregates metrics between feature-flagged functionality and existing production applications.
- Test the tagging and metric collection process by enabling and disabling feature flags and verifying that metrics are accurately captured and separated in the monitoring tool.
- Review the dashboards to ensure that they display the metrics for each functionality independently and provide actionable insights.
- Simulate scenarios that trigger alerts to confirm that they are generated based on the appropriate context and do not cross-contaminate between new and existing features.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to implement and manage the segregation of metrics.
- Access to the codebase to modify instrumentation for tagging and segregating metrics based on feature flags.
- Collaboration with product and development teams to define key metrics for new features and verify the tracking setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and tagged metrics for feature-flag-enabled functionality to differentiate them from existing production metrics.
- Should have updated the monitoring tools to segregate and track metrics separately for new features and the existing system.
- Should have configured dashboards to display metrics for feature-flagged functionality and existing applications independently.
- Should have tested the setup to ensure accurate metric collection, segregation, and analysis for both new and existing features.
- Should have documented the changes and provided guidance on how to interpret the segregated metrics.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Segregating Metrics for Feature-Flagged Functionality
Given the implementation of metric tagging based on feature flags,
When a feature is enabled via a feature flag,
Then the metrics collected should be tagged and segregated from the metrics of the existing production system.

#### Scenario: Independent Monitoring and Alerts
Given the separation of metrics between new and existing features,
When an alert threshold is breached,
Then the alert should be context-specific and triggered based on the metrics from the relevant functionality.

#### Scenario: Reviewing Segregated Metrics on Dashboards
Given the setup of separate dashboards for new and existing features,
When the team reviews the dashboards,
Then they should see metrics independently tracked and visualized for feature-flag-enabled functionality and the existing production application.
