# Conduct and document end-to-end user perspective testing
### Summary
**As a** Quality Assurance Engineer, **I want** to conduct and document end-to-end user perspective testing, **So That** we can ensure that the application meets user requirements, provides a seamless user experience, and functions correctly across all user interactions and workflows.

This story focuses on performing comprehensive end-to-end testing from the user's perspective to validate the functionality, performance, and usability of the application. The goal is to simulate real-world user scenarios, identify potential issues, and ensure that the application delivers a consistent and reliable experience across different use cases.

### Vision
End-to-end user perspective testing allows us to validate the entire user journey, from initial interaction to task completion, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions. By documenting the testing process and results, we provide a clear record of the application's performance and usability, helping to identify areas for improvement and ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.

### Background
Current testing practices may focus primarily on individual components or unit tests, which might not capture the full user experience or detect issues that arise during complex interactions. Conducting end-to-end testing from the user's perspective is crucial for identifying functional gaps, performance issues, and usability problems that could impact the overall user experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to conduct end-to-end user perspective testing to ensure that the application functions correctly and provides a seamless user experience. By documenting the testing process and results, we aim to identify and resolve any issues, ensuring a high-quality product that meets user needs.

## Details
1. **Define User Scenarios and Test Cases**:
    - Collaborate with product managers, designers, and users to identify key user scenarios that represent typical user interactions with the application.
    - Develop detailed test cases for each scenario, covering the full user journey, including navigation, data input, feature usage, and expected outcomes.
    - Include variations in user interactions, such as different input data, user roles, and device types, to ensure comprehensive coverage.

2. **Execute End-to-End Testing**:
    - Perform the end-to-end tests in a staging or testing environment that closely mirrors production, using real or realistic test data to simulate user behavior.
    - Document the steps taken during each test, including the actions performed, the expected results, and the actual outcomes.
    - Capture any issues encountered during testing, such as functional defects, performance bottlenecks, or usability concerns, providing detailed descriptions and screenshots if applicable.

3. **Analyze and Report Results**:
    - Analyze the test results to identify any discrepancies between the expected and actual outcomes, categorizing issues by severity and impact on the user experience.
    - Provide a summary of the testing outcomes, highlighting key findings, successes, and areas that require further attention or improvement.
    - Collaborate with the development team to prioritize and address any identified issues, ensuring they are resolved before the application is released.

4. **Documentation**:
    - Create a comprehensive testing report that includes the test scenarios, test cases, execution steps, results, and identified issues.
    - Include recommendations for improving the user experience based on the findings, such as enhancements to functionality, performance, or usability.
    - Document any lessons learned or best practices identified during the testing process to guide future testing efforts.

5. **Review and Iterate**:
    - Review the testing process and results with stakeholders, including product managers, developers, and users, to gather feedback and refine the testing approach.
    - Schedule regular end-to-end user perspective testing as part of the release process to ensure ongoing validation of the user experience.

### Testing
- Execute the defined user scenarios and test cases in a controlled environment to ensure that they accurately represent real-world user interactions.
- Validate that the application behaves as expected in each scenario, providing the correct responses and maintaining consistent performance and usability.
- Record the results of each test, including any discrepancies, defects, or performance issues encountered, and document them for further analysis.
- Review the documented results with stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the user experience and to identify areas for improvement.

### External Dependencies
- Access to a staging or testing environment that closely mirrors the production environment for conducting end-to-end tests.
- Collaboration with product managers, designers, and users to define key user scenarios and validate the test cases.
- Integration with testing tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress) for automating parts of the end-to-end testing process, if applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and defined key user scenarios and detailed test cases that cover the full user journey.
- Should have executed end-to-end user perspective tests, documenting the steps, expected outcomes, and actual results for each scenario.
- Should have analyzed the test results, identified any issues, and provided a summary report with recommendations for improvements.
- Should have documented the entire testing process, including the scenarios, test cases, results, and any identified issues or recommendations.
- Should have reviewed the results with stakeholders and iterated on the testing process to ensure comprehensive validation of the user experience.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Conducting End-to-End User Perspective Testing
Given the definition of user scenarios and test cases,
When the end-to-end tests are executed,
Then the application should perform as expected, providing the correct outcomes and maintaining a seamless user experience.

#### Scenario: Identifying and Documenting Issues
Given the execution of end-to-end testing,
When a discrepancy or issue is encountered,
Then it should be documented with detailed information, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and impact on the user experience.

#### Scenario: Reviewing and Improving the User Experience
Given the completion of end-to-end testing,
When the results are reviewed,
Then stakeholders should identify areas for improvement and implement changes to enhance the overall user experience.
