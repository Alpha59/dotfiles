# Define feature flag policy of gradual release mechanism for changes to allow rapid dial-down
### Summary
**As an** Engineer, **I want** to define a feature flag policy that incorporates a gradual release mechanism for changes, **So That** we can control the deployment of new features, reduce risk, and quickly roll back or dial-down changes in case of unforeseen issues.

This story aims to establish a standardized feature flag policy that allows for gradual feature rollout and rapid rollback if needed. By using this approach, we can safely introduce new features to a subset of users, monitor their performance, and make data-driven decisions on wider deployment or rollback.

### Vision
Implementing a feature flag policy with a gradual release mechanism provides a controlled way to introduce changes and mitigate risks associated with deploying new features. This approach allows for careful monitoring of new features in production with minimal user impact. In the event of issues, the ability to quickly disable or dial-down the feature minimizes disruption and enhances system stability.

### Background
Currently, changes are often deployed directly to all users, which can lead to unexpected issues and disruptions if the new feature has defects or performance problems. A feature flag policy with a gradual release mechanism enables staged rollouts, starting with a small percentage of users and gradually expanding based on positive feedback and performance metrics. This minimizes the risk of introducing defects and allows for rapid rollback if necessary.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to define a comprehensive feature flag policy that supports gradual feature release and rapid dial-down capabilities. This initiative will help improve the reliability and quality of feature deployments, reduce the impact of defects, and provide greater control over the release process.

## Details
1. **Define Feature Flag Policy**:
    - Establish guidelines for using feature flags, including naming conventions, scoping, and lifecycle management (e.g., creation, usage, retirement).
    - Specify the criteria for when to use feature flags, such as for new features, experimental changes, or performance optimizations.

2. **Implement Gradual Release Mechanism**:
    - Define the process for gradually releasing new features using feature flags, starting with a small percentage of users and incrementally increasing exposure based on performance and feedback.
    - Include support for various release strategies, such as percentage-based rollouts, canary releases, and targeted user groups.

3. **Enable Rapid Dial-Down and Rollback**:
    - Implement a mechanism to rapidly disable or dial-down features using feature flags in case of detected issues or negative user impact.
    - Ensure that feature flags can be toggled on or off without requiring a full redeployment, providing immediate control over feature availability.

4. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
    - Integrate monitoring tools to track the performance and user feedback of features under gradual release, using metrics such as error rates, latency, user engagement, and satisfaction.
    - Define thresholds and automated alerts to detect issues during the gradual rollout, triggering immediate dial-down if necessary.

5. **Documentation and Training**:
    - Document the feature flag policy, including guidelines for creation, usage, and retirement of feature flags.
    - Provide training for developers, QA, and product teams on using feature flags, the gradual release process, and how to respond to issues requiring rapid dial-down.

### Testing
- Conduct tests to validate the feature flag implementation, ensuring that features can be enabled, disabled, or dialed down correctly.
- Simulate gradual release scenarios to verify that new features are rolled out in stages and that metrics are accurately collected and monitored.
- Test the rapid dial-down mechanism to ensure that features can be quickly disabled in response to detected issues without requiring a full redeployment.
- Monitor feature performance and user impact during test rollouts to confirm that the policy works as intended and to identify any areas for improvement.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with a feature flag management tool (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Split, or custom-built solution).
- Access to monitoring and analytics tools to track feature performance and user impact during rollouts.
- Collaboration with development, QA, and product teams for policy implementation and training.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a documented feature flag policy that outlines the use, management, and lifecycle of feature flags.
- Should have implemented a gradual release mechanism that supports percentage-based rollouts and other release strategies.
- Should have a rapid dial-down mechanism in place, allowing for immediate disabling of features in response to issues.
- Should have integrated monitoring and alerting for tracking feature performance during gradual releases.
- Should have conducted training sessions for the team on using feature flags and executing gradual releases.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Gradual Release Using Feature Flags
Given the need to release a new feature,
When the feature flag is enabled for a small percentage of users,
Then the rollout should be monitored, and the feature should be gradually released to a wider audience based on performance metrics.

#### Scenario: Rapid Dial-Down of a Feature
Given the detection of issues during a feature rollout,
When the feature flag is dialed down,
Then the feature should be immediately disabled or reduced in scope to minimize customer impact.

#### Scenario: Monitoring Feature Performance During Rollout
Given a gradual feature release,
When the feature is enabled for users,
Then monitoring tools should collect performance and user engagement metrics to guide the rollout process.
