# Add Keep-Alive Directives for External calls made by the Lambda
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add keep-alive directives for external calls made by AWS Lambda functions, **So That** we can reduce connection overhead, improve performance, and optimize resource usage when interacting with external services.

This story focuses on implementing keep-alive directives in HTTP clients used by AWS Lambda functions to maintain persistent connections to external services. By reusing existing connections, we aim to reduce the latency and overhead associated with establishing new connections, leading to improved performance and reduced costs.

### Vision
Adding keep-alive directives to external calls made by Lambda functions will enhance performance by reducing the time spent on establishing new connections for each request. This optimization reduces the latency of external calls, particularly when interacting with APIs or services that require frequent communication. It also leads to more efficient use of resources, contributing to cost savings and improved application responsiveness.

### Background
Currently, Lambda functions may establish a new connection for each external call, leading to increased latency and resource consumption. This can affect the performance of the application, especially when making numerous or frequent calls to external services. Implementing keep-alive directives allows Lambda functions to reuse existing connections, reducing connection setup time and improving overall efficiency.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to add keep-alive directives to external calls made by Lambda functions to enhance performance and resource utilization. This initiative aims to reduce connection overhead, improve response times, and optimize the interaction with external services.

## Details
1. **Identify External Calls in Lambda Functions**:
    - Review the Lambda functions to identify all instances where external calls are made, such as HTTP requests to APIs, third-party services, or other external resources.
    - Determine the HTTP clients or libraries used for making these calls, such as `requests` in Python, `http` or `axios` in Node.js.

2. **Implement Keep-Alive Directives**:
    - Modify the HTTP clients or libraries in the Lambda functions to include keep-alive directives. For example:
        - In Python with `requests`, use a `Session` object to enable connection pooling and reuse:
          ```python
          import requests
          session = requests.Session()
          response = session.get('https://example.com/api')
          ```
        - In Node.js with `axios`, use an `http.Agent` to set the keep-alive option:
          ```javascript
          const axios = require('axios');
          const http = require('http');
          const agent = new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true });

          axios.get('https://example.com/api', { httpAgent: agent })
            .then(response => {
              // Handle response
            });
          ```
    - Ensure that the keep-alive configuration is appropriate for the expected request load and the characteristics of the external service, such as setting the connection timeout and maximum socket reuse.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Test the modified Lambda functions in a staging environment to verify that keep-alive is working as expected and that connections are being reused.
    - Monitor the performance of external calls to ensure that latency is reduced and that there are no negative impacts, such as connection timeouts or failures.
    - Use monitoring tools to track the number of established connections and connection reuse rates.

4. **Monitor and Optimize**:
    - Monitor the performance of the Lambda functions in production to ensure that the keep-alive implementation is improving response times and reducing connection overhead.
    - Adjust the keep-alive settings as needed based on observed performance and the behavior of the external services, such as tuning connection timeout or max socket reuse limits.

5. **Documentation and Rollout**:
    - Document the changes made to the Lambda functions, including the implementation of keep-alive directives and any configuration settings used.
    - Roll out the changes to the production environment, ensuring minimal disruption to existing operations.

### Testing
- Execute the modified Lambda functions in a staging environment to validate that keep-alive directives are in effect and that connections to external services are being reused.
- Measure the response times and connection metrics before and after implementing keep-alive to confirm that performance improvements are achieved.
- Monitor for any errors or issues related to connection handling, such as timeouts or unexpected disconnections, to ensure that the keep-alive configuration is stable.
- Test under different load conditions to ensure that the keep-alive settings are appropriate and provide consistent performance benefits.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the AWS Lambda functions and the external services they interact with for implementing and testing keep-alive directives.
- Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to track connection metrics and performance.
- Collaboration with the development team to validate the changes and monitor the impact on production workloads.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and modified the Lambda functions that make external calls to include keep-alive directives in their HTTP clients.
- Should have tested the implementation in a staging environment to verify that connections are being reused and that performance is improved.
- Should have monitored the impact of keep-alive on response times and resource usage to ensure that it provides the desired benefits.
- Should have documented the keep-alive implementation and configuration settings for future reference and maintenance.
- Should have rolled out the changes to production, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to existing operations.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Implementing Keep-Alive Directives in Lambda Functions
Given the use of external calls in Lambda functions,
When keep-alive directives are implemented,
Then the Lambda functions should reuse existing connections, reducing latency and improving performance.

#### Scenario: Testing Keep-Alive Implementation
Given the modification of Lambda functions to use keep-alive,
When the functions are executed in a staging environment,
Then the connections to external services should be reused, and performance metrics should indicate improved response times.

#### Scenario: Monitoring and Optimizing Keep-Alive Settings
Given the deployment of Lambda functions with keep-alive,
When the functions are monitored in production,
Then they should demonstrate reduced connection overhead and consistent performance without errors or timeouts.
