# Create, test, and document database backup restoration process
### Summary
**As a** Database Administrator, **I want** to create, test, and document a database backup restoration process, **So That** we can ensure data integrity, provide a reliable method for data recovery in case of data loss or corruption, and maintain business continuity.

This story focuses on developing a detailed process for restoring database backups, including the creation of backup schedules, the execution of restoration procedures, and the validation of restored data. By thoroughly testing and documenting the process, we ensure that the team can confidently perform restorations when needed, minimizing downtime and data loss.

### Vision
A well-documented and tested database backup restoration process ensures that we can quickly and accurately recover data in the event of an unexpected failure, corruption, or data loss. This process provides the necessary steps to restore the database to a consistent state, preserving data integrity and minimizing operational impact. Having this procedure in place is critical for maintaining high availability and protecting against irrecoverable data loss.

### Background
Currently, the absence of a documented and tested database restoration process can lead to delays and increased risk during recovery efforts. Without a defined process, restoring data can be error-prone, potentially leading to extended downtime or further data corruption. Implementing and validating a backup restoration process is essential to ensure a reliable recovery mechanism.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to create, test, and document a comprehensive database backup restoration process, enabling quick and effective recovery of data in case of loss or corruption. This initiative aims to protect data integrity, reduce downtime, and maintain business continuity.

## Details
1. **Define Backup Restoration Requirements**:
    - Identify the types of backups available (e.g., full, incremental, differential) and determine the appropriate restoration scenarios for each type.
    - Define Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) to establish acceptable data loss and recovery timeframes.

2. **Develop Restoration Procedures**:
    - Create a step-by-step restoration procedure for each type of backup, detailing the commands, tools, and configurations needed to perform the restoration.
    - Include procedures for restoring to different environments (e.g., production, staging, development) and scenarios such as point-in-time recovery.
    - Develop validation steps to verify the integrity and consistency of the restored database, including data checksums, integrity checks, and functional validation.

3. **Test the Restoration Process**:
    - Perform restoration tests using the defined procedures on a non-production environment to ensure the process works as expected.
    - Simulate various scenarios, such as full database recovery, point-in-time recovery, and partial data restoration, to validate the process's reliability and completeness.
    - Document the results of the tests, including any issues encountered and the steps taken to resolve them.

4. **Document the Restoration Process**:
    - Create a detailed documentation of the restoration process, including prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
    - Include a checklist of actions to be taken before, during, and after the restoration, such as notifying stakeholders, verifying backups, and performing post-restoration validation.
    - Provide guidelines for regular review and updating of the documentation to keep it current with any changes in the database environment.

5. **Training and Review**:
    - Provide training to the database and operations teams on executing the restoration process, ensuring they are familiar with the procedures and can perform restorations effectively.
    - Schedule regular reviews and drills to maintain readiness and ensure that the team is prepared to execute the restoration process in case of an actual incident.

### Testing
- Execute the backup restoration process in a controlled, non-production environment to verify that it accurately restores the database to the desired state.
- Perform data validation checks post-restoration to ensure data integrity and consistency, including verifying data integrity checksums and running application-level tests.
- Test various restoration scenarios, including full database recovery, point-in-time recovery, and partial data restoration, to ensure the process covers all potential recovery needs.
- Review logs and monitor system performance during the restoration to identify any potential bottlenecks or issues.

### External Dependencies
- Access to database backup files and the ability to create and manage backups for testing purposes.
- Availability of a non-production environment to safely perform and validate the restoration process.
- Collaboration with the database and operations teams to define restoration requirements, execute tests, and validate the process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have developed a detailed step-by-step database backup restoration procedure for each type of backup.
- Should have tested the restoration process in a non-production environment to ensure it works as expected and meets the defined RPOs and RTOs.
- Should have documented the restoration process, including prerequisites, instructions, validation steps, and troubleshooting guidelines.
- Should have provided training for the team on executing the restoration process and maintaining the documentation.
- Should have scheduled regular reviews and drills to ensure ongoing readiness for database recovery.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Executing a Full Database Restoration
Given the existence of a full database backup,
When the restoration process is executed,
Then the database should be restored to the backup state, with all data and configurations intact and validated for integrity.

#### Scenario: Performing Point-in-Time Recovery
Given a point-in-time recovery scenario,
When the restoration process is followed,
Then the database should be restored to the specified point in time, with all transactions up to that point accurately recovered.

#### Scenario: Documenting the Restoration Process
Given the completion of the restoration procedures,
When the process is documented,
Then it should include detailed instructions, validation steps, and troubleshooting tips to guide the team during an actual restoration event.
