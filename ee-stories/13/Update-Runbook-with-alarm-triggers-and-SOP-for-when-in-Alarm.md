# Update Runbook with alarm triggers and SOP for when in Alarm
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to update the Runbook with detailed alarm triggers and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for when the system is in an alarm state, **So That** on-call engineers can efficiently respond to incidents, minimize downtime, and ensure the system's stability and reliability.

This story focuses on enhancing the Runbook to include specific details about each alarm trigger and the corresponding steps that should be taken when an alarm is triggered. By linking the Runbook to alarm tickets, we provide immediate access to the necessary procedures, streamlining incident response and improving the efficiency of the on-call process.

### Vision
Updating the Runbook to include detailed alarm triggers and SOPs for handling alarm states ensures that on-call engineers have clear, actionable instructions for responding to incidents. This reduces the time to resolution, minimizes the impact of incidents on system performance and user experience, and ensures a consistent and effective response to alarms across the team.

### Background
Currently, the Runbook may lack specific details about alarm triggers and the corresponding SOPs, leading to potential delays in incident response and an increased risk of improper handling. By providing detailed instructions and linking the Runbook to alarm tickets, we can streamline the incident management process, improving the team's ability to quickly and effectively address issues.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to update the Runbook with detailed information on alarm triggers and SOPs for handling alarm states, and to ensure that alarm tickets are linked to the Runbook. This initiative aims to improve incident response times, reduce downtime, and maintain system reliability.

## Details
1. **Identify and Document Alarm Triggers**:
    - Review all existing alarms in the monitoring system to identify the specific conditions that trigger each alarm, such as threshold breaches, error rates, or latency spikes.
    - Document the purpose of each alarm, including what it monitors, why it is important, and the potential impact of the issue it indicates.

2. **Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**:
    - Develop detailed SOPs for each alarm, outlining the steps that on-call engineers should take when an alarm is triggered.
    - Include instructions for initial investigation, diagnosis, and remediation, as well as any specific commands, tools, or scripts that should be used.
    - Provide guidance on when to escalate the issue to higher-level support or other teams if it cannot be resolved within a certain timeframe.

3. **Update the Runbook**:
    - Incorporate the documented alarm triggers and SOPs into the Runbook, organizing them in a clear and accessible format.
    - Include a section in the Runbook that explains how to interpret alarm notifications, prioritize alarms based on severity, and follow the appropriate SOPs.
    - Ensure that the Runbook is kept up-to-date with any changes to alarms or procedures, establishing a process for regular reviews and updates.

4. **Link Runbook to Alarm Tickets**:
    - Update the alarm configuration in the monitoring system (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) to include a link to the relevant section of the Runbook in each alarm ticket.
    - Ensure that the link is accessible to on-call engineers and provides immediate access to the SOPs needed to address the alarm.

### Testing
- Test the updated Runbook by conducting simulated alarm scenarios to ensure that the documented SOPs provide clear and effective guidance for resolving incidents.
- Validate that the alarm tickets generated by the monitoring system include the correct link to the Runbook, and that the link directs on-call engineers to the relevant SOPs.
- Review the Runbook with on-call engineers to ensure that the instructions are clear, complete, and actionable, gathering feedback for any further improvements.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the monitoring system and alarm configurations for updating ticket links and reviewing alarm triggers.
- Collaboration with the engineering and operations teams to define and validate the SOPs for each alarm.
- Integration with the documentation system or platform where the Runbook is maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and documented the specific triggers for each alarm, including the purpose and potential impact of each.
- Should have created detailed SOPs for responding to each alarm, outlining the steps for investigation, diagnosis, and remediation.
- Should have updated the Runbook with the alarm triggers and SOPs, ensuring it is well-organized and easily accessible.
- Should have linked the Runbook to alarm tickets in the monitoring system, providing immediate access to the relevant SOPs for on-call engineers.
- Should have tested the updated Runbook and ticket links to ensure they provide effective support for incident response.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Updating the Runbook with Alarm Triggers and SOPs
Given the review of existing alarms,
When the Runbook is updated,
Then it should include detailed triggers and SOPs for each alarm, providing clear guidance for incident response.

#### Scenario: Linking the Runbook to Alarm Tickets
Given the configuration of alarm tickets in the monitoring system,
When an alarm is triggered,
Then the ticket should include a link to the relevant section of the Runbook, directing the on-call engineer to the appropriate SOPs.

#### Scenario: Validating the Updated Runbook and Ticket Links
Given the execution of simulated alarm scenarios,
When the on-call engineer follows the SOPs,
Then they should be able to effectively investigate and resolve the alarm using the instructions provided in the Runbook.
