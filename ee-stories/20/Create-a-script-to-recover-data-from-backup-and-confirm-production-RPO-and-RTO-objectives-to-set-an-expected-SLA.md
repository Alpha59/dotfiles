# Create a script to recover data from backup and confirm production RPO and RTO objectives to set an expected SLA
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to create a script to recover data from backup and confirm that the production environment meets the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective), **So That** we can validate that the recovery process adheres to the expected SLA (Service Level Agreement) for system downtime and data loss during incidents.

This story focuses on automating the data recovery process from backups to verify that the system can be restored within the defined RPO and RTO objectives. The RPO defines the maximum acceptable data loss, and the RTO defines the maximum time allowed for the system to be recovered after a failure. The script will ensure that both objectives are met, allowing us to set a reliable SLA for production recovery.

### Vision
By automating the data recovery process and measuring the actual RPO and RTO, we can validate whether the production environment meets its recovery objectives. This ensures that the business is protected against excessive data loss and downtime, providing confidence in the system's resilience and ability to recover from outages within acceptable limits.

### Background
RPO and RTO are critical parameters for ensuring business continuity during system outages. The RPO defines how much data loss can be tolerated, while the RTO defines how long the system can be down. Manually verifying recovery times and data loss during backup restores can be time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process ensures repeatability, reliability, and continuous validation of the system's recovery capabilities.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to create a script that automates the recovery of data from backups and measures whether the recovery process meets the defined RPO and RTO objectives. This process will validate the system's ability to recover from failures and provide a clear SLA for data recovery and downtime in production environments.

## Details
### 1. Define the RPO and RTO Objectives
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For example, if the RPO is 5 minutes, then during a failure, the system should not lose more than 5 minutes of data.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum amount of time the system can be offline. For example, if the RTO is 30 minutes, the system should be fully operational within 30 minutes of an outage.

### 2. Set Up Backup and Recovery Infrastructure
Ensure that the following are in place:
  - **Automated Backups**: Verify that the system is configured to take regular backups (e.g., RDS snapshots, EBS snapshots, or file system backups) that align with the RPO.
  - **Data Storage**: Backups should be securely stored in an accessible location (e.g., S3, RDS snapshot storage).
  - **Recovery Infrastructure**: Have a recovery process or playbook in place to restore from backups (e.g., restoring from an RDS snapshot or EBS snapshot).

### 3. Write a Recovery Script
The script will automate the following steps:
  - **Retrieve Latest Backup**: Identify and retrieve the latest backup from the backup system (e.g., RDS snapshots, S3, or another backup storage).
  - **Restore the Data**: Trigger the restore process (e.g., restore an RDS instance from a snapshot or mount an EBS volume).
  - **Measure RPO**: Verify the time difference between the latest data available in the backup and the current time to calculate data loss. Ensure this aligns with the defined RPO.
  - **Measure RTO**: Start a timer when the recovery process begins, and stop the timer when the system is fully restored. Ensure the recovery time meets the RTO objective.
  - **Confirm Data Integrity**: Run automated checks (e.g., database consistency checks, file integrity checks) to verify that the recovered data is accurate and complete.

#### Example Python Script to Recover from RDS Snapshot:
```python
import boto3
import time

# AWS RDS and EC2 Clients
rds = boto3.client('rds')
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Variables
snapshot_identifier = 'mydb-snapshot-identifier'
db_instance_identifier = 'mydb-restored-instance'
rpo_objective = 300  # RPO in seconds (5 minutes)
rto_objective = 1800  # RTO in seconds (30 minutes)

# Step 1: Retrieve Latest Backup (RDS Snapshot)
def get_latest_rds_snapshot(snapshot_id):
    response = rds.describe_db_snapshots(DBSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot_id)
    latest_snapshot = sorted(response['DBSnapshots'], key=lambda x: x['SnapshotCreateTime'], reverse=True)[0]
    return latest_snapshot

# Step 2: Restore from Snapshot
def restore_from_rds_snapshot(snapshot):
    print(f'Restoring DB instance from snapshot: {snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier']}')
    start_time = time.time()
    rds.restore_db_instance_from_db_snapshot(
        DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
        DBSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier'],
        DBInstanceClass='db.t3.medium',
        MultiAZ=False,
        PubliclyAccessible=False
    )

    # Wait until the instance is available
    waiter = rds.get_waiter('db_instance_available')
    waiter.wait(DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier)

    # Measure RTO
    end_time = time.time()
    rto_actual = end_time - start_time
    print(f'RTO: {rto_actual} seconds')

    if rto_actual > rto_objective:
        print('RTO objective exceeded!')
    else:
        print('RTO objective met.')

# Step 3: Measure RPO
def check_rpo(snapshot):
    snapshot_time = snapshot['SnapshotCreateTime']
    current_time = time.time()
    rpo_actual = (current_time - snapshot_time.timestamp())

    print(f'RPO: {rpo_actual} seconds')
    if rpo_actual > rpo_objective:
        print('RPO objective exceeded!')
    else:
        print('RPO objective met.')

# Step 4: Confirm Data Integrity
def confirm_data_integrity():
    # Example query to check database integrity
    # This can be extended to check specific tables or data accuracy
    print('Running data integrity checks...')
    # Assume data check is passed
    print('Data integrity checks passed.')

# Main Script Execution
snapshot = get_latest_rds_snapshot(snapshot_identifier)
check_rpo(snapshot)
restore_from_rds_snapshot(snapshot)
confirm_data_integrity()
```

### 4. Automate Data Integrity Checks
- Add steps to the script to automatically run data integrity checks after the recovery. This could include:
  - **Database Consistency Checks**: Query the restored database to verify that key tables, rows, and indexes are intact and consistent.
  - **File System Integrity Checks**: Verify that files and directories are restored correctly, with proper permissions and file integrity.
  - **Application-Level Tests**: Optionally, run application tests against the restored environment to ensure that the application behaves as expected after recovery.

### 5. Set Up Reporting and Notifications
- Add logging and reporting to the script to document the RPO, RTO, and data integrity results. This report will be used to confirm that the system meets the expected SLA.
- Optionally, set up notifications (e.g., using ** SNS** or email) to notify the team of the recovery results and whether the RPO and RTO objectives were met.

#### Example of Sending Notifications with SNS:
```python
sns = boto3.client('sns')
sns_topic_arn = '<sns-topic-arn>'

def send_notification(subject, message):
    sns.publish(
        TopicArn=sns_topic_arn,
        Subject=subject,
        Message=message
    )
```

### 6. Schedule and Automate the Recovery Test
- Schedule the script to run periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) to automatically test the recovery process and validate the RPO and RTO objectives.
- Use **AWS CloudWatch Events** or a **cron job** to trigger the script execution.

#### Example CloudWatch Rule to Trigger the Script (using Lambda or ECS Task):
```json
{
  'source': [
    'aws.events'
  ],
  'detail-type': [
    'Scheduled Event'
  ],
  'resources': [
    'arn:aws:events:region:account-id:rule/ScheduledRule'
  ],
  'detail': {}
}
```

### 7. Validate and Adjust SLAs
- Based on the recovery test results, validate the current SLA for RPO and RTO. If the actual recovery times exceed the objectives, work with the team to optimize the backup process, restore infrastructure, or reduce data loss.
- Document the confirmed RPO and RTO metrics and use these as the basis for setting or adjusting the SLA for recovery in production environments.

### Testing
- **RPO Validation**: Test various backup intervals to verify that the system can recover with minimal data loss (e.g., < 5 minutes of data loss for an RPO of 5 minutes).
- **RTO Validation**: Test the systemâ€™s recovery speed by simulating a failure and verifying that the system is restored within the allowed RTO (e.g., < 30 minutes).
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Run data integrity checks after recovery to ensure that the restored data is complete and correct.

### External Dependencies
- **AWS Services**: Integration with AWS RDS, S3, EBS, and SNS for backups and notifications.
- **Database Engines**: Ensure the database engine used for backups (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) supports snapshot restores and consistency checks.
- **Backup Tools**: If using third-party backup tools, ensure that they are compatible with the recovery script.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have written and automated a script to recover data from the latest backup and verify whether the system meets the defined RPO and RTO.
- Should have integrated data integrity checks to confirm the accuracy and completeness of restored data.
- Should have scheduled and automated the recovery test to run periodically, ensuring continuous validation of the RPO and RTO objectives.
- Should have set up reporting and notifications to notify the team when recovery tests complete and whether the SLA objectives were met.
- Should have documented and confirmed the RPO and RTO results to set an appropriate SLA for production recovery.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Recovering Data from Backup
Given the system has an automated backup process,
When the recovery script is triggered,
Then it should restore the latest backup and measure the RPO and RTO to confirm compliance with the defined objectives.

#### Scenario: Verifying Data Integrity
Given that a backup has been restored,
When the data integrity checks are run,
Then the system should confirm that all data has been accurately restored.

#### Scenario: Reporting RPO and RTO
Given a recovery test has completed,
When the RPO and RTO are measured,
Then the results should be reported and compared against the SLA.
