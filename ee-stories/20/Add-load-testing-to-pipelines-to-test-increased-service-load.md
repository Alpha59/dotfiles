# Add load testing to pipelines to test increased service load
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add load testing to the CI/CD pipelines to simulate increased service load, **So That** we can ensure that the system can handle spikes in traffic, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that the service remains reliable under high load conditions.

This story focuses on integrating load testing into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically test how the service performs under increased load before deploying changes. By incorporating load testing, we can verify that new changes do not degrade performance or cause failures when the service is subjected to higher-than-normal traffic volumes.

### Vision
Adding load testing to the pipeline ensures that every release is tested under simulated high-load conditions. This allows the team to detect and address potential performance issues before they reach production, ensuring that the service can scale and handle increased traffic without affecting reliability or user experience.

### Background
Currently, performance and load testing may be conducted manually or sporadically, which can lead to undetected issues during high-traffic events. Integrating load testing into the CI/CD pipeline allows for continuous validation of service scalability and reliability, ensuring that the system can handle high loads without performance degradation or failures.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement automated load testing in the CI/CD pipeline, allowing the service to be tested for increased traffic volumes as part of the deployment process. This enables the team to proactively address performance bottlenecks and ensure that the service remains reliable under high load.

## Details
### 1. Choose a Load Testing Tool
Select a load testing tool that integrates with your CI/CD pipeline and supports simulating high traffic volumes. Common load testing tools include:
  - **Artillery**: A modern load testing toolkit that is easy to integrate with CI pipelines.
  - **Apache JMeter**: A widely used load testing tool that can simulate heavy loads on a system.
  - **Locust**: A Python-based load testing tool that allows writing user scenarios in Python.
  - **k6**: A performance testing tool designed for running automated tests within CI/CD pipelines.

#### Example Load Testing Tools:
- **Artillery**: Simple to configure, easy integration with CI/CD.
- **Apache JMeter**: Offers comprehensive load and performance testing with support for various protocols.
- **k6**: Focuses on developer-friendly load testing with scripting in JavaScript.

### 2. Define Load Testing Scenarios
Define the load testing scenarios that simulate real-world usage patterns. Key scenarios might include:
  - **Steady Load**: Simulate a constant rate of requests over a fixed time period to test the system's ability to handle expected traffic.
  - **Spike Test**: Simulate a sudden increase in traffic (e.g., doubling or tripling request volume) to test how the system responds to short-term traffic spikes.
  - **Stress Test**: Gradually increase the load until the system fails to determine the maximum capacity it can handle.
  - **Soak Test**: Run a constant load over an extended period to ensure that the system can sustain high traffic without degrading over time.

#### Example of a Load Testing Scenario with Artillery (YAML):
```yaml
config:
  target: 'https://your-service-url.com'
  phases:
    - duration: 300
      arrivalRate: 10
    - duration: 300
      arrivalRate: 50
scenarios:
  - flow:
      - get:
          url: '/api/v1/resource'
```
In this example, the service will be tested with an increasing load over time, starting with 10 requests per second and then ramping up to 50 requests per second.

### 3. Add Load Testing to the CI/CD Pipeline
Integrate the load testing tool into the CI/CD pipeline, running load tests as part of the pipeline after the build and unit/integration tests.

#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow with Artillery for Load Testing:
```yaml
name: Load Testing

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  load-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm install -g artillery

      - name: Run Load Test
        run: |
          artillery run load-test.yml

      - name: Upload Load Test Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: load-test-results
          path: load-test-results/
```

In this example, the pipeline runs an Artillery load test after a code push or pull request. The load test results are uploaded as artifacts for review.

#### Example GitLab CI Pipeline with k6 for Load Testing:
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - load-test

load_test:
  stage: load-test
  image: loadimpact/k6
  script:
    - k6 run --vus 50 --duration 5m load-test.js
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - load-test-results/
```
This example runs a k6 load test with 50 virtual users for 5 minutes.

### 4. Set Performance Criteria for Load Tests
Define performance thresholds and criteria that must be met during load testing to pass the pipeline. These may include:
  - **Latency**: The service must respond within a specific average or 95th percentile response time (e.g., < 500ms).
  - **Error Rate**: The number of failed requests must not exceed a defined threshold (e.g., < 1%).
  - **Throughput**: The system must handle a specified number of requests per second without degradation.

Set these criteria based on the service’s performance goals and SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

#### Example Artillery Threshold Configuration:
```yaml
config:
  target: 'https://your-service-url.com'
  phases:
    - duration: 600
      arrivalRate: 100
  defaults:
    http:
      maxRetries: 2
  thresholds:
    http_req_duration:
      p95: ['<', 500]   # 95% of requests must respond within 500ms
    errors:
      rate: ['<', 0.01]  # Less than 1% error rate
```

### 5. Store and Analyze Load Test Results
After running the load tests, store the test results and analyze the performance metrics to determine whether the system meets the defined criteria. Use tools like **CloudWatch**, **Grafana**, or built-in reporting tools from the load testing framework to visualize and analyze the results.

#### Example of Retrieving Artillery Load Test Results:
```bash
artillery run --output load-test-report.json load-test.yml
```

- Upload the results as artifacts in the pipeline for easy access and review.
- Generate performance reports using the load testing tool's reporting features or integrate with a dashboard for deeper analysis.

### 6. Set Alarms for Performance Failures
Configure alarms in your CI/CD pipeline to notify the team if the load tests fail. For example:
  - Set a threshold on the test failure criteria (e.g., if latency or error rate exceeds the defined limit).
  - Use services like **Slack**, **PagerDuty**, or ** SNS** to send notifications if the load test fails.

### 7. Monitor and Optimize Service Performance
- Continuously monitor the service’s performance under increased load and review the load test results after each deployment.
- Use load test data to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation (e.g., scaling policies), and fine-tune the service configuration for better performance under high traffic.

### Testing
- **Simulate Increased Load**: Use load testing tools to simulate increasing traffic volumes, and verify that the service can handle the load while maintaining acceptable latency and error rates.
- **Test Failure Scenarios**: Simulate failure scenarios, such as traffic spikes that exceed the service’s capacity, and verify that alarms are triggered, and the failure is handled appropriately.
- **Compare Against Baseline**: Run load tests for each deployment and compare the results against the baseline performance to detect any regressions.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with load testing tools such as Artillery, Apache JMeter, Locust, or k6.
- Integration with the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automate the load tests.
- Monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch, Grafana, or Prometheus to track performance metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have integrated a load testing tool (e.g., Artillery, k6, Apache JMeter) into the CI/CD pipeline to test service performance under increased load.
- Should have defined load testing scenarios (e.g., steady load, spike tests, stress tests) that simulate real-world usage patterns.
- Should have configured performance criteria (e.g., latency, error rate, throughput) to ensure that the service meets the defined thresholds during load testing.
- Should have stored and analyzed load test results after each deployment to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Should have configured alarms to notify the team when load tests fail or performance degrades during increased load.
- Should have documented the load testing process and criteria for passing the tests.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Running Load Tests in the Pipeline
Given a CI/CD pipeline with integrated load testing,
When the pipeline is triggered,
Then the service should be subjected to load testing scenarios to simulate increased traffic volumes.

#### Scenario: Analyzing Load Test Results
Given the load tests are completed,
When the test results are available,
Then the results should be analyzed to determine if the service meets the performance criteria for latency, error rates, and throughput.

#### Scenario: Handling Load Test Failures
Given the load test fails due to exceeding the error rate threshold,
When the failure occurs,
Then an alarm should trigger, notifying the team to investigate the issue.
