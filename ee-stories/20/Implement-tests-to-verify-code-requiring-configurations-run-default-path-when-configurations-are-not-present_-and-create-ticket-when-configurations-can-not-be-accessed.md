# Implement tests to verify code requiring configurations run default path when configurations are not present, and create ticket when configurations can not be accessed
### Summary
**As a** Software Developer, **I want** to implement tests to verify that code requiring configurations runs the default path when configurations are not present, **So That** the system continues to operate using default settings in the absence of configuration files and creates a ticket when configurations cannot be accessed, **So That** issues with configuration retrieval are proactively addressed.

This story focuses on creating automated tests that validate the system’s behavior when configuration files or environment variables are missing or inaccessible. The tests will ensure that the system falls back to default behavior in these scenarios and raises a ticket to notify the team when the configurations cannot be retrieved.

### Vision
By implementing these tests, we can ensure that the system gracefully handles missing configurations by using default values, and we can proactively detect and resolve configuration access issues through automated ticket creation. This improves the robustness and resilience of the system and ensures that configuration-related issues are quickly addressed.

### Background
In many systems, configuration files or environment variables are critical to customizing application behavior. However, the system should be able to fall back to default settings when configurations are unavailable, ensuring continued operation. Additionally, detecting and resolving configuration access issues promptly is essential to maintaining service reliability. Automated tests and ticket creation will help monitor and mitigate configuration issues in real time.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement tests that ensure the system follows default paths when configurations are missing and automatically creates a ticket when configurations cannot be accessed. This ensures the system is resilient to configuration failures and proactively alerts the team to investigate the issue.

## Details
### 1. Identify Code Requiring Configurations
- Identify the parts of the code that rely on configurations (e.g., reading from environment variables, configuration files like YAML or JSON). For example:
  - **Database Configurations**: Settings for connecting to a database (e.g., host, port, credentials).
  - **API Endpoints**: External API URLs or keys required by the service.
  - **Feature Flags**: Configuration settings that toggle specific features on or off.

### 2. Implement Default Behavior for Missing Configurations
Ensure that the code is designed to fall back to a set of default values when configurations are missing or inaccessible. These default values should be predefined and ensure that the system operates in a safe, minimal capacity.

#### Example Code for Default Behavior in Python:
```python
import os

# Default configuration values
DEFAULT_DB_HOST = 'localhost'
DEFAULT_DB_PORT = 5432

def get_database_config():
    db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST', DEFAULT_DB_HOST)  # Use default if not present
    db_port = int(os.getenv('DB_PORT', DEFAULT_DB_PORT))  # Use default if not present
    return db_host, db_port

db_host, db_port = get_database_config()
print(f'Connecting to database at {db_host}:{db_port}')
```

### 3. Write Tests to Verify Default Path Execution
Write automated tests that simulate scenarios where the configuration is missing, and verify that the system correctly falls back to the default values.

#### Example Python Test Using `unittest`:
```python
import os
import unittest
from your_module import get_database_config

class TestDefaultConfigPath(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_default_config_path(self):
        # Simulate missing configuration by clearing environment variables
        os.environ.pop('DB_HOST', None)
        os.environ.pop('DB_PORT', None)

        # Call the function that retrieves the database config
        db_host, db_port = get_database_config()

        # Assert that default values are used
        self.assertEqual(db_host, 'localhost')
        self.assertEqual(db_port, 5432)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test, the `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` environment variables are deliberately cleared to simulate missing configurations. The test verifies that the default values are used.

### 4. Implement Logic to Create Tickets for Configuration Access Issues
Implement logic in the code that attempts to create a ticket or send an alert when configurations cannot be accessed. This could involve:
  - **Ticket Creation API**: If your organization uses a ticketing system (e.g., JIRA, ServiceNow), implement API calls to automatically create a ticket when configuration access fails.
  - **Logging and Alerting**: Log the issue and trigger an alert (e.g., using  SNS or another alerting service).

#### Example Python Code to Create a JIRA Ticket for Configuration Issues:
```python
import requests

def create_jira_ticket(issue_summary, issue_description):
    jira_url = 'https://your-jira-instance/rest/api/2/issue'
    auth = ('jira-username', 'jira-api-token')
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

    data = {
        'fields': {
            'project': {
                'key': 'YOURPROJECTKEY'
            },
            'summary': issue_summary,
            'description': issue_description,
            'issuetype': {
                'name': 'Bug'
            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(jira_url, auth=auth, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print('JIRA ticket created successfully')
    else:
        print(f'Failed to create JIRA ticket: {response.status_code} {response.text}')

def handle_config_error():
    issue_summary = 'Configuration Access Failure'
    issue_description = 'The system was unable to access the required configurations.'
    create_jira_ticket(issue_summary, issue_description)
```

In this example, if the configuration access fails, a JIRA ticket is automatically created using the JIRA API.

### 5. Implement Tests to Verify Ticket Creation on Configuration Failure
Write tests that simulate a configuration access failure and verify that a ticket or alert is created. This could be done by mocking the API call to the ticketing system.

#### Example Python Test Using `unittest.mock`:
```python
from unittest.mock import patch
import unittest
from your_module import handle_config_error

class TestTicketCreation(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('your_module.create_jira_ticket')
    def test_ticket_creation_on_config_failure(self, mock_create_ticket):
        # Simulate configuration access failure
        handle_config_error()

        # Verify that the create_jira_ticket function was called
        mock_create_ticket.assert_called_with(
            'Configuration Access Failure',
            'The system was unable to access the required configurations.'
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test mocks the `create_jira_ticket` function to ensure that it is called when configuration access fails.

### 6. Integrate Tests into CI/CD Pipeline
Ensure that these tests are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate that the system behaves correctly when configurations are missing. These tests should:
  - Verify that the system falls back to default behavior when configurations are absent.
  - Verify that tickets are created or alerts are triggered when configurations cannot be accessed.

### 7. Set Up Monitoring for Configuration Access Issues
Configure monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus) to track configuration access failures. This ensures that configuration-related issues are detected and reported in real-time, even outside of the test environment.

### Testing
- **Missing Configuration Test**: Simulate missing configurations by removing environment variables or configuration files, and verify that the system falls back to default behavior.
- **Ticket Creation Test**: Simulate a failure to access configurations and verify that a ticket is created or an alert is sent to notify the team.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration Test**: Verify that the tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and run automatically with every build.

### External Dependencies
- **Ticketing System API**: Ensure that you have access to the ticketing system’s API (e.g., JIRA, ServiceNow) to automate ticket creation.
- **Monitoring and Alerting Tools**: If using external monitoring tools, ensure they are properly configured to track configuration access issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Handling Missing Configurations with Default Behavior
Given the system requires configurations to operate,
When the configurations are missing,
Then the system should fall back to the default behavior without failure.

#### Scenario: Creating a Ticket on Configuration Access Failure
Given the system requires configurations,
When the system is unable to access the configurations,
Then a ticket should be automatically created to notify the team of the issue.

#### Scenario: Verifying Default Path Execution with Tests
Given the system requires configurations,
When the configuration tests are run,
Then the tests should verify that the system uses default values when configurations are missing.
