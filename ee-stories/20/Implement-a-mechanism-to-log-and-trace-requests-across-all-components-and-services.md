# Implement a mechanism to log and trace requests across all components and services
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to implement a mechanism to log and trace requests across all components and services, **So That** I can track the flow of requests throughout the system, identify performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively by analyzing end-to-end request data.

This story focuses on creating a comprehensive logging and tracing mechanism that captures request data across all services and components in a distributed system. The goal is to have complete visibility into how requests flow through the system, enabling better debugging, performance monitoring, and root cause analysis.

### Vision
By implementing a logging and tracing mechanism across all services, we can gain full visibility into the lifecycle of a request as it traverses different components. This allows for faster identification of performance bottlenecks, improved troubleshooting capabilities, and enhanced observability in production environments.

### Background
In distributed systems, requests often travel through multiple services, making it difficult to trace the flow of a single request and identify where issues occur. By implementing centralized logging and distributed tracing, we can track individual requests across all services, allowing for better insight into how the system behaves and improving the ability to troubleshoot and optimize performance.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement a robust logging and tracing mechanism across all components and services to track requests end-to-end. This will help improve system observability, enhance debugging, and enable better performance monitoring.

## Details
### 1. Choose Logging and Tracing Tools
- Select tools that will support centralized logging and distributed tracing across all services. Commonly used tools include:
  - **OpenTelemetry**: A popular open-source framework for distributed tracing and observability.
  - **AWS X-Ray**: A tracing service for analyzing and debugging distributed applications built on AWS.
  - **Jaeger**: An open-source distributed tracing system.
  - **Zipkin**: Another distributed tracing system for tracking request flows.
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For centralized logging, aggregation, and visualization.

### 2. Implement Distributed Tracing Across All Services
Use distributed tracing to track the path of each request as it moves through multiple services. Distributed tracing involves assigning each request a unique trace ID that is passed along with the request as it moves between services.

#### Steps to Implement Distributed Tracing:
1. **Inject a Trace ID** into the request at the entry point (e.g., when a request first hits an API or frontend).
2. **Propagate the Trace ID** across all services by passing it along with the request (e.g., in HTTP headers or metadata for other communication protocols).
3. **Capture Spans** for each service or component that handles the request. A span is a single unit of work that represents an operation within the trace (e.g., database query, external API call, etc.).
4. **Send Tracing Data** to a central tracing system (e.g., AWS X-Ray, Jaeger, or Zipkin).

#### Example Code for Injecting and Propagating a Trace ID (Python using OpenTelemetry):
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor

# Set up the tracer provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(
    TracerProvider(resource=Resource.create({SERVICE_NAME: 'my-service'}))
)

# Set up the OTLP exporter
span_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint='your-otlp-endpoint')
span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(span_exporter)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Instrument outgoing requests with the trace ID
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()

# Use the tracer to create spans
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span('process-request'):
    # Code for processing the request
    response = requests.get('http://your-service-url')
```

### 3. Centralize Logs for All Services
Implement a centralized logging solution that collects logs from all services in one place. This will allow for easy querying, analysis, and troubleshooting of issues. Use a logging format that includes the **trace ID** to correlate logs with trace data.

#### Example of a Structured Log with Trace ID (Python):
```python
import logging
import json
from opentelemetry import trace

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_message(message, level='info'):
    current_span = trace.get_current_span()
    trace_id = current_span.get_span_context().trace_id

    log_data = {
        'message': message,
        'trace_id': format(trace_id, '032x')  # Convert trace ID to a readable format
    }

    if level == 'info':
        logging.info(json.dumps(log_data))
    elif level == 'error':
        logging.error(json.dumps(log_data))

# Example log entry
log_message('Processing request', level='info')
```

### 4. Ensure Logs and Traces are Correlated
Ensure that logs generated by each service include the trace ID, allowing for correlation between logs and traces. This makes it easier to follow the request flow in the logs while also analyzing the performance and timing of each service using the trace data.

#### Example of Including Trace ID in Logs (Python):
```python
def process_request():
    # Generate a trace ID for this request
    trace_id = trace.get_current_span().get_span_context().trace_id
    logging.info(f'Processing request with trace_id: {trace_id}')

    # Perform request processing...
    log_message('Request processed successfully')
```

### 5. Visualize Logs and Traces
Set up a monitoring dashboard to visualize the collected logs and trace data. This can be done using tools like **Elasticsearch**, **Kibana**, **Grafana**, or **AWS X-Ray**. These dashboards provide insights into the performance of each service, identify bottlenecks, and highlight issues in real-time.

#### Example of an X-Ray Service Map (AWS):
AWS X-Ray automatically generates a service map, which shows how requests flow between services and where bottlenecks or errors occur. You can use this to visualize request flow and identify problematic services.

### 6. Configure Alerts for Request Anomalies
Set up alerts based on anomalies detected in logs and traces. For example:
  - Set up alerts for requests that exceed certain latency thresholds.
  - Create alerts for error traces where a request fails.
  - Trigger alerts based on specific log messages (e.g., 'request timeout' or 'service unavailable').

Alerts can be set up using ** CloudWatch**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **Elastic Alerting**. These alerts can notify the DevOps team via email, Slack, or another notification system when an issue occurs.

### 7. Test Logging and Tracing Mechanism
Test the logging and tracing mechanism to ensure that:
  - **Trace IDs are generated** for all incoming requests.
  - **Trace IDs are propagated** across all services.
  - **Logs and trace data are correlated**, allowing end-to-end visibility of the request.
  - **Alerts are triggered** when anomalies are detected in request flows or logs.

### Testing
- **End-to-End Tracing Test**: Simulate a request from the frontend to the backend and ensure that the trace ID is propagated across all services. Verify that the trace data is available in the tracing system and that logs contain the trace ID.
- **Log Correlation Test**: Ensure that logs generated by different services include the correct trace ID and that logs can be correlated with traces.
- **Alerting Test**: Simulate a service failure or latency spike and verify that alerts are triggered and notifications are sent to the appropriate team.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with distributed tracing tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray, Jaeger, Zipkin).
- Integration with centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK Stack, AWS CloudWatch Logs).
- Use of monitoring tools for visualization and alerting (e.g., Kibana, Grafana,  X-Ray).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Should have centralized logging with logs that include the trace ID for correlation with traces.
- Should have a mechanism for visualizing trace and log data in real-time using tools like X-Ray, Jaeger, or ELK.
- Should have configured alerts for anomalies in request performance, failures, or logs.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Propagating Trace IDs Across Services
Given a request is initiated in the system,
When the request is passed through multiple services,
Then each service should propagate the trace ID,
And the trace data should be available for analysis in the tracing tool.

#### Scenario: Correlating Logs with Trace Data
Given the system logs request data,
When logs are generated,
Then each log should include the trace ID to correlate with the distributed trace.

#### Scenario: Triggering Alerts for Request Anomalies
Given a request anomaly is detected,
When the anomaly exceeds the predefined threshold,
Then an alert should be triggered, notifying the DevOps team.
