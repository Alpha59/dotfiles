# Configure alarms on the service dashboards for database errors and throttling
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to configure alarms on service dashboards to monitor database errors and throttling, **So That** we can quickly detect and respond to issues affecting database performance, preventing disruptions to the services relying on the database.

This story focuses on setting up alarms that monitor key database metrics, such as query errors and throttling events, and configuring them to trigger notifications and appear on the service dashboards. This ensures that the team is alerted promptly when database performance is degraded due to errors or resource constraints.

### Vision
By configuring alarms for database errors and throttling on service dashboards, we provide real-time visibility into critical issues that may impact application performance. This allows the team to detect and mitigate issues proactively, minimizing downtime and service disruptions.

### Background
Database errors and throttling events can severely impact the performance and availability of applications. Errors such as failed queries or throttling due to resource limits can cause slowdowns, data inconsistencies, or complete service outages. By configuring alarms and displaying them on service dashboards, we can monitor these issues in real-time and respond quickly when problems arise.

## Details

### 1. **Identify Key Metrics for Database Errors and Throttling**
   - Common metrics to monitor for database errors and throttling include:
     - **Error Metrics**:
       - **Database Connections Errors**: Failures when the service cannot connect to the database.
       - **Query Errors**: Failed database queries due to syntax errors, constraint violations, or timeout issues.
       - **Transaction Rollbacks**: Occurs when a transaction fails and must be rolled back.
     - **Throttling Metrics**:
       - **CPU and Memory Utilization**: High resource usage may lead to throttling by the database service.
       - **Query Throttling**: When database queries are rate-limited due to reaching throughput limits (e.g., in managed services like AWS RDS).
       - **IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)**: High IOPS utilization may indicate throttling or performance degradation.
       - **Read/Write Latency**: Increased latency in read/write operations may suggest throttling or resource exhaustion.

### 2. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for RDS (or Other Databases)**
   - **RDS Metrics**: If using  RDS, set up alarms on the following key CloudWatch metrics:
     - `DatabaseConnections`: Monitor for connection issues or sudden drops in active connections.
     - `ReadIOPS` and `WriteIOPS`: Monitor the number of read/write operations per second and watch for spikes that may lead to throttling.
     - `CPUUtilization`: Alarm on high CPU usage (e.g., above 80% for a sustained period).
     - `FreeableMemory`: Alarm when available memory drops below a threshold (e.g., below 100MB).
     - `ThroughputExceeded`: Monitor for query throttling events.

   Example AWS CLI command to create an alarm for database connection errors:
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'DBConnectionErrors'      --metric-name DatabaseConnections --namespace AWS/RDS      --statistic Maximum --period 60 --threshold 5      --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold      --evaluation-periods 2 --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
   ```

   Example CLI command to create an alarm for CPU utilization:
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'HighCPUUtilization'      --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/RDS      --statistic Average --period 60 --threshold 80      --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold      --evaluation-periods 2 --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
   ```

### 3. **Set Up Notifications for Alarms**
   - Configure the alarms to trigger notifications through **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**, allowing teams to receive alerts via email, SMS, or automated systems like Slack when thresholds are exceeded.
   - Ensure that each alarm is linked to the appropriate notification channel to provide real-time visibility into database errors and throttling.

   Example to create an SNS topic for alarm notifications:
   ```bash
   aws sns create-topic --name DatabaseAlarmsTopic
   ```
   - Subscribe team members or automated tools to the SNS topic:
   ```bash
   aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns-topic-arn> --protocol email --notification-endpoint youremail@example.com
   ```

### 4. **Configure Service Dashboards to Display Alarms**
   - Use **CloudWatch Dashboards** to display the status of alarms directly on the service monitoring dashboards. This provides at-a-glance visibility of database health and any triggered alarms.
   - Add widgets to the dashboard to display the database error and throttling alarms, along with key performance metrics such as CPU utilization, IOPS, and latency.

   Example CloudWatch dashboard widget configuration:
   ```json
   {
     'type': 'metric',
     'x': 0,
     'y': 0,
     'width': 6,
     'height': 6,
     'properties': {
       'metrics': [
         [ 'AWS/RDS', 'CPUUtilization', 'DBInstanceIdentifier', 'my-db-instance' ],
         [ '.', 'DatabaseConnections', '.', 'my-db-instance' ]
       ],
       'view': 'timeSeries',
       'stacked': false,
       'region': 'us-east-1',
       'period': 60,
       'stat': 'Average',
       'title': 'Database Performance Metrics'
     }
   }
   ```

   - Include widgets that show the alarm status, such as 'DatabaseConnectionErrors' or 'HighCPUUtilization.' You can configure the dashboard to highlight when an alarm is triggered, providing immediate visibility to the team.

### 5. **Monitor and Test Alarms**
   - Test the alarms by simulating conditions that trigger them, such as increasing database load to induce throttling or causing connection errors. Confirm that the alarms trigger correctly and notifications are sent.
   - Regularly monitor the alarms to ensure they are correctly configured and providing useful insights. Adjust thresholds based on real-world data to reduce false positives or missed alerts.

### 6. **Configure Alarm Actions (Optional)**
   - For critical database errors or throttling issues, configure automated actions in response to triggered alarms. These actions could include:
     - Scaling the database instance (for RDS) if resource limits are exceeded.
     - Automatically restarting the database instance if connection errors persist.
     - Triggering Lambda functions to perform custom remediation actions.

   Example CLI command to set an alarm action that triggers an auto-scaling event:
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name 'HighCPUUtilization'      --alarm-actions arn:aws:autoscaling:region:account-id:autoScalingGroupName/my-asg:policyName/my-scaling-policy
   ```

### Testing
- Test each alarm by simulating high traffic, resource exhaustion, or database connection failures.
- Validate that the alarms trigger notifications through SNS and that the dashboard displays alarms in real-time.
- Review the alarm history in CloudWatch to ensure accuracy and adjust thresholds based on operational requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have configured alarms to monitor key database metrics, including errors and throttling conditions.
- Should have notifications configured through SNS to alert the appropriate team members.
- Should have the service dashboard updated to display real-time status of the alarms and relevant database performance metrics.
- Should have tested the alarms to ensure they are triggered and notifications are sent under the correct conditions.
- Should have monitoring in place to ensure continued visibility and performance tracking for database health.
