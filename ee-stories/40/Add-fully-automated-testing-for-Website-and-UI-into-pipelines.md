# Add fully automated testing for Website/UI into pipelines
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to add fully automated testing for Website/UI into pipelines, **So That** we can ensure continuous quality assurance of the user interface (UI) and website functionality, catching potential issues early in the development cycle before they reach production.

This story focuses on integrating end-to-end (E2E) UI tests and website functionality tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing for critical user interactions and website performance. The automated tests will cover functional, regression, and visual testing to ensure consistent and error-free deployments.

### Vision
By integrating fully automated website and UI tests into the pipeline, we ensure that every code change undergoes rigorous testing, improving code quality, minimizing manual testing efforts, and reducing the likelihood of defects making it to production. This provides continuous feedback on the stability and functionality of the website.

### Background
Automated testing for UIs and websites is essential to catch functional or visual issues early. Manual testing can be time-consuming and prone to human error, especially as websites become more complex. Automated UI tests ensure that critical flows, like user login, form submissions, and page navigation, work as expected. Tools like Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright can be used to automate browser-based testing.

## Details

### 1. **Select the Right Testing Tools**
   - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing Tools**:
     - **Cypress**: Easy to use, with built-in commands for UI interaction and network stubbing.
     - **Selenium**: Widely used for web testing across multiple browsers.
     - **Playwright**: Supports cross-browser testing, including Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit.
   - **Test Frameworks**:
     - Use **Mocha**, **Jest**, or **Cucumber** for behavior-driven development (BDD) to structure your tests.
   - **Continuous Integration (CI) Tools**:
     - Integrate with existing CI systems like **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, **GitHub Actions**, or **AWS CodePipeline**.

### 2. **Define Key UI Flows to Test**
   - Identify and document critical user flows that need to be tested automatically, such as:
     - **User Login/Logout**: Test both valid and invalid login attempts.
     - **Form Submission**: Test form validation and data submission across multiple scenarios.
     - **Page Navigation**: Ensure navigation between pages is functioning correctly.
     - **Search Functionality**: Verify that search inputs return the correct results.
     - **Responsive Design**: Test that the UI renders correctly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Include tests for visual regression to detect any unwanted UI changes.

### 3. **Write Test Scripts**
   - Develop automated test scripts for the defined key flows. Example Cypress code to test a login flow:
   ```javascript
   describe('Login Test', () => {
     it('Logs in with valid credentials', () => {
       cy.visit('https://yourwebsite.com/login');
       cy.get('input[name='email']').type('testuser@example.com');
       cy.get('input[name='password']').type('password123');
       cy.get('button[type='submit']').click();
       cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
       cy.contains('Welcome, Test User');
     });

     it('Fails login with invalid credentials', () => {
       cy.visit('https://yourwebsite.com/login');
       cy.get('input[name='email']').type('testuser@example.com');
       cy.get('input[name='password']').type('wrongpassword');
       cy.get('button[type='submit']').click();
       cy.contains('Invalid email or password');
     });
   });
   ```

### 4. **Add Tests to Pipeline**
   - Modify the CI/CD pipeline configuration to run the automated tests during the build or pre-deployment phase.
   - Example GitHub Actions workflow:
   ```yaml
   name: E2E Tests

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     e2e-tests:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Run E2E Tests
           run: npm run test:e2e
   ```
   - Ensure the pipeline runs tests automatically on every pull request (PR) or commit to specific branches (e.g., `main`, `dev`).

### 5. **Parallel and Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Configure the pipeline to support parallel test execution to speed up testing:
     - Use a service like **Cypress Dashboard** or **Selenium Grid** for parallel test execution.
   - Set up cross-browser testing to ensure the website works on multiple browsers:
     - **Playwright** and **Selenium** provide built-in cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
     - Example Cypress parallel testing setup:
     ```bash
     cypress run --parallel --record --key <your-project-key>
     ```

### 6. **Reporting and Notifications**
   - Configure reporting for test results:
     - Use built-in reporters like **Mocha** or third-party services like **Cypress Dashboard** to generate detailed test reports.
   - Configure the pipeline to send notifications (via Slack, email, etc.) if tests fail:
     - Use tools like **Slack Notifications** or email plugins in CI tools to notify the team in case of test failures.
   - Example Slack notification integration in Jenkins:
   ```groovy
   post {
     failure {
       slackSend (channel: '#ci-alerts', message: 'Test Failed: $\{env.JOB_NAME} [$\{env.BUILD_NUMBER}]')
     }
   }
   ```

### 7. **Integrate Visual Regression Testing**
   - Implement visual regression testing to ensure UI components appear correctly across versions:
     - Tools like **Percy**, **Applitools**, or **BackstopJS** can capture screenshots of UI components and compare them against previous baselines to detect visual differences.
   - Example integration with Cypress using Percy:
   ```javascript
   describe('Visual Regression Test', () => {
     it('Captures homepage snapshot', () => {
       cy.visit('https://yourwebsite.com');
       cy.percySnapshot('Homepage');
     });
   });
   ```

### 8. **Ensure Environment Parity**
   - Ensure that the environment used for automated tests matches the actual production environment as closely as possible. This includes:
     - Using realistic test data.
     - Replicating production-like database states.
     - Mocking or stubbing any third-party services that are not easily accessible during testing.

### Testing
- Validate that the tests execute successfully in the pipeline and provide accurate results.
- Test the setup by making changes that break the website's functionality and ensuring that the automated tests detect these issues.
- Run tests across multiple browsers and devices to ensure broad coverage.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Should have fully automated UI and website testing integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Should have end-to-end tests covering key UI flows (e.g., login, form submissions, navigation).
- Should have cross-browser and responsive design testing configured.
- Should have a reporting mechanism in place to provide detailed insights into test results.
- Should have failure notifications configured for the team to react promptly.
- Should have integrated visual regression testing to detect unintended UI changes.
