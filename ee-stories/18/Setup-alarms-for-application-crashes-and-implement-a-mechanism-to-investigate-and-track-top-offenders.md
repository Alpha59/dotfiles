# Setup alarms for application crashes and implement a mechanism to investigate and track top offenders
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to set up alarms for application crashes and implement a mechanism to investigate and track the top offenders, **So That** we can promptly detect and respond to crashes, identify recurring issues, and improve application stability and reliability.

This story focuses on implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms for application crashes, as well as creating a system to log and analyze crash data. By identifying the top offenders—components or actions that most frequently cause crashes—we can prioritize fixes and improvements, reducing the overall crash rate and enhancing user experience.

### Vision
Setting up alarms for application crashes and establishing a mechanism to investigate and track top offenders enables proactive management of application stability. By detecting crashes in real-time, responding quickly, and analyzing recurring issues, we can improve the application's reliability, reduce downtime, and ensure a smoother user experience.

### Background
Currently, application crashes may go undetected or lack sufficient tracking, leading to prolonged outages and repeated occurrences of the same issues. Without alarms and a tracking mechanism, identifying and addressing the root causes of crashes becomes challenging, impacting the application's performance and user satisfaction.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to set up alarms for application crashes and implement a mechanism to log, investigate, and track the top offenders. This initiative aims to improve application stability by ensuring that crashes are detected promptly, investigated thoroughly, and addressed effectively.

## Details
1. **Set Up Crash Detection and Alarms**:
    - Integrate crash detection into the application using monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Sentry) to capture crash events and errors.
    - Configure alarms to trigger when a crash is detected, based on error logs, exceptions, or application exit codes.
    - Set threshold-based alarms to distinguish between single occurrences and repeated or critical crashes, ensuring that the appropriate level of response is initiated.

2. **Implement a Crash Logging Mechanism**:
    - Enhance the application logging to capture detailed information about each crash, including the timestamp, error message, stack trace, user actions leading up to the crash, and system state.
    - Store crash logs in a centralized location (e.g., a logging server, cloud storage) for easy access and analysis.
    - Anonymize sensitive user data in the logs to comply with privacy and security policies.

3. **Develop a Tracking and Analysis System**:
    - Create a system to aggregate and analyze crash logs, identifying patterns and categorizing crashes based on factors such as error type, frequency, and affected components.
    - Implement a dashboard or reporting tool to visualize crash data, highlighting the top offenders—components or actions that most frequently cause crashes.
    - Use tools such as Elasticsearch and Kibana or a similar logging analysis solution to query and visualize crash data.

4. **Automated Investigation and Notification**:
    - Automate the initial investigation of crashes by setting up rules or scripts that analyze the logs for known issues, common patterns, or high-severity errors.
    - Configure notifications to alert the relevant team members when a critical crash or top offender is identified, providing them with detailed log data for further investigation.

5. **Continuous Improvement and Reporting**:
    - Review the crash data regularly to identify trends, root causes, and opportunities for improvement.
    - Track the resolution of identified top offenders, ensuring that fixes are implemented, tested, and deployed.
    - Provide regular reports on crash metrics, trends, and resolution progress to stakeholders, highlighting improvements in application stability.

### Testing
- Test the alarm setup by intentionally causing controlled crashes in a test environment to verify that the alarms are triggered correctly and notifications are sent to the appropriate channels.
- Validate the crash logging mechanism to ensure that it captures all necessary information, including error details, stack traces, and context around the crash.
- Simulate various crash scenarios to test the tracking and analysis system's ability to aggregate, categorize, and identify top offenders.
- Review the automated investigation and notification process to confirm that it accurately detects and escalates critical crashes and provides actionable information.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with monitoring and logging tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Sentry) for crash detection, logging, and alerting.
- Access to the application's source code and environment for implementing crash logging and testing the alarm system.
- Collaboration with the development team to analyze crash data and implement fixes for identified top offenders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have set up alarms for application crashes, including threshold-based alerts to distinguish between single and repeated crashes.
- Should have implemented a logging mechanism to capture detailed information about each crash and store it centrally.
- Should have developed a tracking and analysis system to identify, categorize, and prioritize top offenders based on crash data.
- Should have automated the initial investigation process and configured notifications for critical crashes and top offenders.
- Should have validated the system through testing, ensuring that crashes are detected, logged, investigated, and addressed effectively.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Detecting and Alerting on Application Crashes
Given the integration of crash detection and alarms,
When an application crash occurs,
Then an alarm should be triggered and a notification sent to the relevant team members with details about the crash.

#### Scenario: Logging and Tracking Crash Information
Given the implementation of a crash logging mechanism,
When an application crash is detected,
Then the system should log detailed information about the crash and store it in a centralized location for analysis.

#### Scenario: Identifying and Investigating Top Offenders
Given the development of a tracking and analysis system,
When crash data is aggregated and analyzed,
Then the system should identify the top offenders and provide insights to the team for further investigation and resolution.
