# Document and develop a disaster recovery plan, including product and operations sign off
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to document and develop a disaster recovery (DR) plan, including obtaining product and operations sign-off, **So That** we can ensure business continuity, minimize downtime, and recover services quickly in the event of a disaster.

This story focuses on developing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan that outlines the steps needed to recover from a disaster, including identifying critical services, recovery processes, and roles and responsibilities. The plan will also include obtaining approval and sign-off from the product and operations teams to ensure alignment and readiness across the organization.

### Vision
Developing and documenting a disaster recovery plan ensures that the organization is prepared to recover quickly from unexpected disasters, such as hardware failures, data breaches, or natural disasters. This plan will define the steps, procedures, and systems needed to restore services and minimize downtime. By involving both the product and operations teams in the sign-off process, the plan will ensure alignment with business objectives and operational requirements.

### Background
Currently, there may be limited or informal disaster recovery planning in place, increasing the risk of prolonged downtime or data loss during a disaster. Without a formal DR plan, critical services and operations may not recover as quickly or efficiently as needed. A well-documented and tested disaster recovery plan ensures that recovery procedures are defined, teams know their roles, and services can be restored promptly in the event of a disaster.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to develop and document a formal disaster recovery plan and obtain sign-off from the product and operations teams. This initiative aims to enhance the organization’s ability to respond to disasters, recover services efficiently, and ensure that business continuity is maintained with minimal disruption.

## Details
1. **Identify Critical Services and Resources**:
    - Collaborate with product, engineering, and operations teams to identify the critical services, applications, and infrastructure that must be prioritized for recovery in the event of a disaster.
    - Categorize services based on their business impact, such as high-priority services that directly affect customers or revenue, and low-priority services that can be restored later.
    - Identify key resources, such as databases, servers, third-party services, and dependencies that are essential for recovery.

2. **Define Recovery Objectives**:
    - Establish clear Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) for each critical service, which define the maximum allowable downtime before significant impact occurs.
    - Define Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs), which specify the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disaster (e.g., no more than 1 hour of data loss).
    - Document these objectives to ensure that recovery efforts align with business expectations and service-level agreements (SLAs).

3. **Develop the Recovery Plan**:
    - Create detailed recovery procedures for each critical service, including:
      - **Backup and Restore Procedures**: How to restore services from backups, including the locations of backups and the systems required to perform the restore.
      - **Failover Mechanisms**: Steps for switching to secondary systems, regions, or services (e.g., multi-region AWS setup) if the primary system fails.
      - **Disaster Scenarios**: Define disaster scenarios such as data center outages, network failures, or security breaches, and provide specific recovery steps for each scenario.
    - Assign roles and responsibilities to the appropriate team members for executing the recovery plan, ensuring that every step has a clear owner.
    - Include communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders, including notifying customers, updating management, and coordinating with third-party providers.

4. **Test and Validate the DR Plan**:
    - Perform disaster recovery drills in a test environment to validate the effectiveness of the plan, simulate disaster scenarios, and ensure that the recovery procedures work as intended.
    - Conduct a tabletop exercise, where the team walks through the disaster recovery plan step-by-step, identifying any gaps or areas for improvement.
    - Monitor the recovery process during these tests, including time to recover (RTO) and the amount of data lost (RPO), and compare the results against the defined objectives.

5. **Obtain Product and Operations Sign-Off**:
    - Present the completed disaster recovery plan to the product and operations teams to ensure alignment with their requirements and business priorities.
    - Solicit feedback from both teams, making any necessary adjustments to the plan based on their input.
    - Obtain formal sign-off from product and operations leadership, ensuring they agree with the plan’s recovery priorities, procedures, and objectives.

6. **Document the DR Plan and Provide Training**:
    - Document the disaster recovery plan in a clear, accessible format, ensuring that all team members can easily reference the procedures and responsibilities.
    - Provide training to the engineering, operations, and product teams on how to execute the disaster recovery plan, including the roles they will play during an actual disaster.
    - Ensure that the plan is regularly reviewed and updated as the infrastructure, services, or business priorities change.

7. **Ongoing Maintenance and Review**:
    - Establish a schedule for regularly testing and updating the disaster recovery plan, ensuring that it remains relevant and effective as the system evolves.
    - Review the plan annually or after any major system changes, and update the RTOs, RPOs, and recovery procedures as needed.
    - Collect and incorporate feedback from disaster recovery drills to continuously improve the plan and optimize recovery times.

### Testing
- Conduct a disaster recovery simulation (e.g., failure of a critical service) in a staging environment to ensure that the recovery steps are effective and that the RTOs and RPOs are met.
- Perform a tabletop exercise with the engineering, product, and operations teams to review the disaster recovery steps and identify any potential gaps or inefficiencies.
- Validate that the disaster recovery plan includes clear steps for each disaster scenario, and that team members understand their roles and responsibilities during recovery.
- Monitor the execution of the recovery procedures and collect metrics on recovery time and data loss to ensure that they align with the business objectives.

### External Dependencies
- Access to backup systems, failover mechanisms, and infrastructure (e.g., AWS regions, database replicas) to test and implement the disaster recovery plan.
- Collaboration with product, engineering, and operations teams to identify critical services, define recovery priorities, and assign responsibilities for disaster recovery execution.
- Tools for backup, monitoring, and disaster recovery orchestration (e.g., AWS Backup, Datadog, PagerDuty) to automate parts of the recovery process and alert the team in case of failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified critical services and established RTOs and RPOs for each service based on business priorities.
- Should have documented detailed recovery procedures, including backup and restore processes, failover mechanisms, and communication protocols for each disaster scenario.
- Should have tested the disaster recovery plan through simulations and tabletop exercises, ensuring that recovery steps are validated and effective.
- Should have obtained formal sign-off from the product and operations teams, ensuring that the plan aligns with business and operational requirements.
- Should have documented the disaster recovery plan and provided training to all relevant teams, ensuring they understand how to execute the plan during a disaster.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Defining Recovery Objectives for Critical Services
Given the identification of critical services,
When recovery objectives are defined,
Then each service should have a clearly documented RTO and RPO that align with business expectations.

#### Scenario: Testing the Disaster Recovery Plan
Given the development of the disaster recovery plan,
When a recovery simulation is performed,
Then the recovery procedures should be executed as planned, and the system should recover within the defined RTO and RPO.

#### Scenario: Obtaining Product and Operations Sign-Off
Given the completion of the disaster recovery plan,
When the plan is reviewed by the product and operations teams,
Then formal sign-off should be obtained, confirming that the plan meets their requirements.
