# Implement configuration tests to capture CDK and configuration changes
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to implement configuration tests to capture CDK (Cloud Development Kit) and configuration changes, **So That** changes in infrastructure and configuration are automatically validated before deployment to ensure correctness, consistency, and prevent unexpected issues during deployment.

This story focuses on implementing automated configuration tests to validate changes made to the CDK code and other configuration files (e.g., environment variables, YAML/JSON configuration). By setting up tests that capture and validate these changes, we can catch errors early in the pipeline and avoid faulty configurations making their way into production.

### Vision
Implementing configuration tests for CDK and configuration changes ensures that any updates to infrastructure or environment settings are thoroughly tested before they are applied. These tests provide an extra layer of validation, reducing the likelihood of deploying broken or misconfigured infrastructure, which could lead to service outages, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues.

### Background
Currently, infrastructure changes made using CDK or configuration updates may not undergo sufficient testing before being deployed. Without automated tests to capture these changes, there is a risk that faulty configurations could make their way into production, leading to potential failures. By implementing configuration tests, we can validate that infrastructure and environment changes are correct, follow best practices, and meet security and operational requirements.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement configuration tests that automatically capture and validate CDK infrastructure changes and other configuration updates. These tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that any changes are validated before deployment.

## Details
### 1. Identify the Configuration Changes to Test
- Identify the types of configuration changes that need to be captured and validated. These may include:
  - **CDK Infrastructure Changes**: Changes to the AWS infrastructure defined using CDK, such as S3 buckets, ECS tasks, Lambda functions, and VPC configurations.
  - **Environment Configuration Changes**: Updates to environment variables, secret management (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager), or configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON).
  - **Security and Compliance Settings**: Changes related to IAM roles, security groups, encryption settings, and resource policies.

### 2. Create Unit Tests for CDK Resources
- **Unit Testing for CDK**: Use the **AWS CDK Assertions Library** to write unit tests for CDK code. These tests should validate that the infrastructure defined in the CDK stack adheres to the expected configuration.

#### Example Unit Test for CDK (using Jest for testing):
```javascript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Template } from 'aws-cdk-lib/assertions';
import { MyCdkAppStack } from '../lib/my-cdk-app-stack';

test('S3 Bucket Created with Correct Configuration', () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  const stack = new MyCdkAppStack(app, 'MyTestStack');

  // Extract the CloudFormation template generated by the stack
  const template = Template.fromStack(stack);

  // Assert that the S3 bucket is created with the correct configuration
  template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::S3::Bucket', {
    BucketName: 'my-bucket',
    VersioningConfiguration: {
      Status: 'Enabled'
    }
  });
});
```

- **Key Assertions for CDK Tests**:
  - Ensure that resources such as **S3 buckets**, **Lambda functions**, **DynamoDB tables**, etc., are created with the correct properties (e.g., encryption, versioning, lifecycle rules).
  - Verify **IAM policies** and **security group rules** to ensure correct access controls and security settings.
  - Validate **networking configurations** (e.g., VPCs, subnets, routing tables) to ensure that they are configured correctly.

### 3. Implement Snapshot Tests for CDK Changes
- Use **Snapshot Testing** to capture the structure of the generated CloudFormation template and compare it with the previous versions to detect changes.
  - When a CDK stack is synthesized, it generates a CloudFormation template that describes the infrastructure. Snapshot tests can capture the template and compare it with previously approved templates.
  - If a change is detected, the test fails, prompting a review of the infrastructure changes.

#### Example of Snapshot Testing in CDK (using Jest):
```javascript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { MyCdkAppStack } from '../lib/my-cdk-app-stack';

test('Snapshot of CDK Stack', () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  const stack = new MyCdkAppStack(app, 'MyTestStack');

  // Compare the synthesized CloudFormation template with the stored snapshot
  expect(stack).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

### 4. Validate Configuration Files (YAML, JSON, Environment Variables)
- Write tests to validate the correctness of configuration files such as YAML or JSON. These configuration files are often used to store environment-specific variables, secrets, or operational settings.

#### Example Test for Configuration Files:
- **YAML File Validation**: Use libraries such as `js-yaml` (for Node.js) or `pyyaml` (for Python) to parse and validate the structure of YAML configuration files.

#### Node.js Example to Validate a YAML File:
```javascript
const yaml = require('js-yaml');
const fs = require('fs');

test('Validate YAML Configuration', () => {
  const config = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync('config.yml', 'utf8'));

  // Assert that the required keys are present and have correct values
  expect(config).toHaveProperty('appName');
  expect(config.appName).toBe('MyApp');

  expect(config).toHaveProperty('database');
  expect(config.database.host).toBe('localhost');
  expect(config.database.port).toBe(5432);
});
```

- **Environment Variable Validation**: Ensure that required environment variables are present and have valid values.

#### Example Python Test for Environment Variables:
```python
import os
import pytest

def test_env_variables():
    assert 'DB_HOST' in os.environ, 'DB_HOST is missing'
    assert os.environ['DB_HOST'] == 'localhost', 'DB_HOST is incorrect'

    assert 'DB_PORT' in os.environ, 'DB_PORT is missing'
    assert int(os.environ['DB_PORT']) == 5432, 'DB_PORT is incorrect'
```

### 5. Integrate Tests into the CI/CD Pipeline
- Integrate the configuration tests into the CI/CD pipeline so that all infrastructure and configuration changes are validated automatically during the build process. This should include:
  - **Running Unit Tests** for CDK to validate that infrastructure resources are correctly configured.
  - **Running Snapshot Tests** to detect unexpected changes in the generated CloudFormation templates.
  - **Running Configuration Tests** to validate YAML, JSON, or environment variable configurations.

#### Example GitHub Actions CI Pipeline for Running CDK Tests:
```yaml
name: CDK Configuration Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run CDK Unit Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Run CDK Snapshot Tests
        run: npm run test:snapshot
```

### 6. Monitor and Review Test Results
- Ensure that the test results from the CI/CD pipeline are monitored and reviewed by the development and operations teams. Any failed test should trigger an investigation into the cause of the failure and ensure that the changes are reviewed before proceeding with deployment.

### 7. Document the Configuration Testing Process
- Document the process of implementing and running configuration tests, including:
  - **How to write and run CDK unit tests**.
  - **How to create and maintain snapshot tests**.
  - **How to validate YAML/JSON configuration files**.
  - **How to integrate the tests into the CI/CD pipeline**.

- Provide training to the development team on how to write and maintain configuration tests, ensuring that all future changes are tested and validated before deployment.

### Testing
- **CDK Unit Tests**: Test CDK infrastructure changes by running unit tests that validate resource properties and ensure that changes follow the expected configuration.
- **Snapshot Tests**: Test the snapshot mechanism by making changes to the CDK stack and ensuring that unexpected changes are detected by the snapshot tests.
- **Configuration File Tests**: Validate YAML, JSON, and environment variable configurations through automated tests that ensure required keys and values are present and correct.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with AWS CDK for defining and managing infrastructure.
- Use of testing frameworks such as **Jest** (JavaScript) or **Pytest** (Python) for running configuration tests.
- Integration with the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run configuration tests during the build process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have implemented unit and snapshot tests to capture and validate CDK infrastructure changes.
- Should have created automated tests for validating YAML, JSON, and environment variable configurations.
- Should have integrated the configuration tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate changes before deployment.
- Should have tested the configuration tests by making changes to CDK stacks and configuration files and verifying that the tests detect issues.
- Should have documented the configuration testing process and provided training to the development team.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: CDK Unit Test for Resource Configuration
Given a CDK stack with infrastructure resources,
When a unit test is run,
Then the test should validate that the resources are created with the correct properties (e.g., S3 bucket with versioning enabled).

#### Scenario: Snapshot Testing for CDK Changes
Given a previously approved CloudFormation template,
When a new CDK stack is synthesized,
Then the snapshot test should detect any unexpected changes and fail the test if differences are found.

#### Scenario: Validation of Configuration Files
Given a YAML configuration file,
When the configuration test is run,
Then the test should validate that required keys and values are present and correct.
