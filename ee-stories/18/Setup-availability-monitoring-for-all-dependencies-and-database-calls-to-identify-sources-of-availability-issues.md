# Setup availability monitoring for all dependencies and database calls to identify sources of availability issues
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to set up availability monitoring for all dependencies and database calls, **So That** we can proactively identify sources of availability issues and resolve them before they impact service reliability and customer experience.

This story focuses on setting up real-time monitoring to track the availability of critical dependencies and database calls. By continuously monitoring these components, we can identify availability issues such as downtime, slow response times, or failures, and take corrective actions quickly to ensure that services remain highly available and perform as expected.

### Vision
Setting up availability monitoring for dependencies and database calls ensures that any availability issues are detected and resolved early, minimizing service disruption. By continuously tracking the availability of external and internal dependencies, as well as database interactions, we can improve system reliability and reduce the risk of downtime, which is critical for maintaining customer trust and meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

### Background
Currently, there may be limited visibility into the availability of external dependencies and database calls, making it difficult to detect availability issues that impact the overall system. Without proper monitoring, availability problems may go unnoticed until they significantly affect customers. This initiative aims to provide real-time visibility into the availability of these components, allowing the team to take prompt action to resolve issues.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement availability monitoring for all critical dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs, microservices) and database calls, ensuring that any availability issues are identified and addressed before they lead to customer-impacting outages. The goal is to enhance system reliability by detecting failures early and responding proactively.

## Details
1. **Identify Critical Dependencies and Database Calls**:
    - Collaborate with the development and operations teams to identify the critical dependencies that need to be monitored for availability. These may include:
      - **Third-party APIs**: External services that the system relies on, such as payment gateways or authentication services.
      - **Internal Microservices**: Services that communicate with each other in a microservices architecture.
      - **Database Calls**: Queries to databases, data stores, and caching systems that are essential for application functionality.
    - Categorize the dependencies and database calls based on their importance to the systemâ€™s availability and the impact of potential outages.

2. **Select Monitoring Tools**:
    - Choose suitable tools to monitor the availability of dependencies and database calls, such as:
      - **AWS CloudWatch**: To monitor the health and availability of AWS services and databases (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB).
      - **Datadog**: For monitoring the availability of external APIs, microservices, and database calls with real-time dashboards and alerts.
      - **Prometheus with Grafana**: To collect and visualize availability metrics for microservices and database queries.
      - **Pingdom or UptimeRobot**: For external uptime checks on third-party APIs and endpoints.
    - Integrate the selected tools into the system to start tracking availability for each dependency and database call.

3. **Define Availability Metrics**:
    - Define the key availability metrics to be monitored for each dependency and database call. These may include:
      - **Uptime**: The percentage of time the service or dependency is available and operational.
      - **Response Times**: The time taken for dependencies and database calls to respond to requests. High response times can indicate availability issues.
      - **Error Rates**: Track error responses from dependencies (e.g., 4xx, 5xx errors) and database queries (e.g., timeouts, failed transactions).
      - **Downtime**: The total time a dependency or database service was unavailable during a given period.
    - Set thresholds for each metric, such as a 99.9% uptime requirement for critical services or a response time threshold of 200ms for API calls.

4. **Implement Availability Monitoring**:
    - Set up monitoring for each identified dependency and database call, using tools such as Datadog or CloudWatch. This may involve:
      - Adding availability checks for external APIs and internal microservices.
      - Monitoring database performance metrics such as query success rates, read/write times, and connection errors.
      - Implementing periodic health checks (e.g., HTTP checks) to confirm that services are available and responding correctly.
    - Ensure that monitoring tools collect availability metrics continuously and store them for historical analysis.

5. **Configure Alerts for Availability Issues**:
    - Set up alerts to notify the operations team when availability issues occur. For example:
      - Trigger an alert if uptime drops below the defined threshold (e.g., below 99.9%).
      - Set up an alert if API response times exceed the acceptable limit for a sustained period.
      - Configure alerts for error rates that exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., more than 1% of requests returning 5xx errors).
    - Ensure that alerts are routed to the appropriate channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) so that the team is notified as soon as availability issues are detected.

6. **Create Availability Dashboards**:
    - Build real-time dashboards that display the availability metrics for all critical dependencies and database calls. These dashboards should include:
      - **Current Uptime**: Display the current uptime percentage for each monitored service or dependency.
      - **Response Times**: Show the average and percentile response times for API calls and database queries.
      - **Error Rates**: Display the error rates for APIs and databases, highlighting services with elevated error levels.
      - **Availability Trends**: Show historical trends for service availability and response times to identify patterns of degradation.
    - Ensure that the dashboards are accessible to the operations and engineering teams for ongoing monitoring.

7. **Test and Validate Monitoring Setup**:
    - Test the availability monitoring system by simulating different types of availability issues. For example:
      - Simulate an API outage or database failure to verify that the monitoring system detects the issue and triggers the appropriate alert.
      - Introduce artificial delays to test response time monitoring and ensure that alerts are triggered when response times exceed thresholds.
    - Ensure that all metrics are being tracked accurately and that alerts are sent to the right team members in a timely manner.

8. **Ongoing Monitoring and Optimization**:
    - Continuously monitor the availability of dependencies and database calls, using the metrics and dashboards set up during the initial implementation.
    - Regularly review the performance of the monitoring system to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the team and can detect availability issues quickly.
    - Optimize the monitoring system based on feedback from the operations team and real-world performance, adjusting thresholds and metrics as needed.

### Testing
- Simulate availability issues (e.g., downtime for an external API or database) to test whether the monitoring system correctly detects the issue and triggers an alert.
- Test the accuracy of the availability metrics by comparing actual downtime and response times with the reported metrics in the dashboard.
- Validate that all alerts are routed to the appropriate team members, and ensure that the escalation paths are working as intended.
- Perform ongoing tests to verify that monitoring tools continue to accurately track the availability of all dependencies and database calls.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus, or Pingdom to track the availability of dependencies and database calls.
- Access to external APIs, internal services, and databases to configure health checks and availability metrics.
- Collaboration with the development and operations teams to identify critical services, set thresholds, and configure alerting mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have implemented availability monitoring for all identified dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs, internal microservices) and database calls.
- Should have defined and tracked key availability metrics such as uptime, response times, error rates, and downtime.
- Should have configured alerts that notify the operations team when availability issues occur or thresholds are exceeded.
- Should have created a real-time dashboard that displays the availability metrics for all monitored dependencies and database calls.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Monitoring Availability for API Dependencies
Given the setup of availability monitoring for API dependencies,
When an API experiences downtime or slow response times,
Then the system should trigger an alert and notify the operations team.

#### Scenario: Monitoring Availability for Database Calls
Given the setup of availability monitoring for database calls,
When a database query fails or experiences high latency,
Then the system should detect the issue and trigger an alert.

#### Scenario: Testing Availability Alerts
Given the setup of availability monitoring and alerting,
When a simulated downtime or outage occurs,
Then the system should trigger the appropriate alert and display the issue on the availability dashboard.
