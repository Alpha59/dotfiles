# Configure alarms on the service dashboard for API and AWS Service level throttling
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to configure alarms on the service dashboard for API and AWS service-level throttling, **So That** we can proactively detect throttling issues that may impact service availability and performance, ensuring that the system responds effectively to avoid service disruptions.

This story focuses on setting up alarms to monitor API and AWS service-level throttling. By detecting throttling early, we can respond quickly to prevent significant performance degradation, service outages, or user experience issues caused by rate limits on APIs or AWS services. These alarms will be displayed on the service dashboard for visibility and real-time monitoring.

### Vision
Configuring alarms for API and AWS service-level throttling helps prevent issues that arise when services exceed their allocated request limits. Early detection of throttling ensures that the operations team is alerted to take action, such as rate-limiting requests, implementing retries, or optimizing service usage, before clients experience service degradation.

### Background
Currently, throttling issues—whether at the API or AWS service level—can cause significant disruptions to service availability and performance. Without proper monitoring and alarms, throttling events may go unnoticed until they impact users. Setting up alarms ensures that the team is alerted promptly, allowing for rapid response to minimize downtime and performance issues.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to configure alarms on the service dashboard to monitor API and AWS service-level throttling events. This initiative aims to improve service reliability by ensuring that throttling issues are detected early and addressed before they affect user traffic or degrade the system’s performance.

## Details
1. **Identify Throttling Metrics**:
    - Identify the specific throttling metrics for both APIs and AWS services to monitor. Examples include:
      - **API Gateway**: `4XXErrorRate` and `5XXErrorRate` for identifying when throttling occurs.
      - **AWS Lambda**: `Throttles` metric for detecting when function invocations are being throttled.
      - **DynamoDB**: `ThrottledRequests` metric for monitoring throttling on read/write requests.
      - **S3**: `ThrottlingErrors` for monitoring when requests to S3 are throttled.
    - Ensure that each relevant AWS service or API being monitored has a corresponding throttling metric that can be tracked.

2. **Set Thresholds for Throttling Alarms**:
    - Define thresholds for when alarms should be triggered based on throttling events. Example criteria include:
      - **API Gateway**: Trigger an alarm if the 4xx/5xx error rate exceeds 5% over a defined time window (e.g., 5 minutes).
      - **Lambda**: Trigger an alarm if the number of throttled invocations exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., more than 100 throttled requests in 5 minutes).
      - **DynamoDB**: Set an alarm for when throttled read/write requests exceed 2% of total requests in a given period.
    - Tailor the thresholds to match service-level agreements (SLAs) and operational requirements to avoid false positives or missed throttling events.

3. **Configure Alarms on the Service Dashboard**:
    - Use AWS CloudWatch or another monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog) to configure alarms for throttling metrics.
    - Add these alarms to the service dashboard to provide real-time visibility into API and AWS service throttling events.
    - Ensure that the dashboard clearly displays the status of each monitored service, showing whether throttling is occurring, the number of throttled requests, and the severity of the issue.

4. **Integrate Alerts and Notifications**:
    - Configure alerts to notify the operations team when throttling thresholds are exceeded. For example:
      - Set up notifications via email, Slack, or PagerDuty to ensure that the team is alerted when a throttling event occurs.
      - Include relevant details in the alerts, such as the service affected, the number of throttled requests, and any error rates associated with the event.
    - Establish escalation paths to ensure that higher-severity throttling issues (e.g., affecting critical services or resulting in high error rates) are addressed immediately.

5. **Monitor and Test Throttling Alarms**:
    - Test the throttling alarms by simulating high traffic scenarios that lead to throttling (e.g., exceeding API Gateway or DynamoDB request limits).
    - Verify that the alarms are triggered as expected and that the alerts provide accurate information for the operations team.
    - Monitor the throttling metrics in real-time to ensure that the alarms are functioning correctly and providing valuable insights into service usage patterns.

6. **Optimize Usage and Mitigate Throttling**:
    - Based on the throttling alarms, analyze usage patterns and identify any services that are frequently hitting throttling limits.
    - Implement mitigation strategies such as:
      - **Rate Limiting**: Control the rate of incoming requests to avoid overwhelming APIs or AWS services.
      - **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement exponential backoff or retry strategies in the application to handle throttling gracefully.
      - **Provisioning Adjustments**: Increase AWS service capacity (e.g., increase provisioned capacity for DynamoDB) to reduce throttling occurrences.

7. **Document Alarm Setup and Response Procedures**:
    - Document the configuration of throttling alarms, including the metrics being monitored, thresholds, and alerting paths.
    - Provide guidelines for responding to throttling events, including steps for investigating and mitigating issues.
    - Ensure that the operations team is trained on how to interpret and respond to throttling alarms and how to implement mitigation strategies.

### Testing
- Simulate throttling by sending a high volume of requests to monitored services (e.g., API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3) and ensure that alarms are triggered based on the defined thresholds.
- Validate that the alarms are correctly displayed on the service dashboard and that alerts are sent to the appropriate teams with sufficient details.
- Test the alert escalation process to ensure that higher-severity throttling issues are escalated quickly for prompt resolution.
- Monitor service performance during simulated throttling events to verify that the system handles throttling gracefully and that fallback mechanisms (e.g., retries) are functioning.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog) for setting up alarms on throttling metrics.
- Access to AWS services (e.g., API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB) for monitoring service-level throttling and gathering relevant metrics.
- Collaboration with the operations team to define appropriate thresholds for throttling alarms and response procedures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified the key throttling metrics for API and AWS services that need to be monitored.
- Should have configured alarms on the service dashboard to monitor API and AWS service-level throttling, with appropriate thresholds and visibility.
- Should have integrated alerts for throttling events with notification channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) to inform the operations team when throttling occurs.
- Should have tested the throttling alarms in a staging environment and verified that they are triggered correctly under simulated throttling scenarios.
- Should have documented the alarm setup and response procedures for throttling events, ensuring the team knows how to mitigate issues and optimize usage.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Configuring Throttling Alarms for API Gateway
Given the monitoring of API Gateway endpoints,
When the error rate exceeds the defined threshold due to throttling,
Then an alarm should be triggered, and a notification should be sent to the operations team.

#### Scenario: Monitoring AWS Service-Level Throttling
Given the setup of throttling alarms for AWS services (e.g., DynamoDB, Lambda),
When a throttling event occurs (e.g., exceeding read/write capacity or invocation limits),
Then the service dashboard should display the throttling metrics, and an alert should be sent to notify the team.

#### Scenario: Testing Throttling Alarms and Alerts
Given the defined thresholds for throttling alarms,
When simulated high traffic causes throttling on a monitored service,
Then the alarms should be triggered, and the alerts should contain detailed information for the operations team to act on.
