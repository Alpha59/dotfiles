# Create and document a “Golden Path” for Security/UI Accessibility/UI Translation/ect to be referenced by future design tasks
### Summary
**As a** Senior Software Engineer, **I want** to create and document a 'Golden Path' for Security, UI Accessibility, UI Translation, and other core design considerations, **So That** future design tasks can reference best practices and ensure consistency, compliance, and quality across the project.

This story focuses on defining and documenting a set of “Golden Path” guidelines for key areas such as Security, UI Accessibility, and UI Translation. These guidelines will serve as a standardized reference for all future design tasks, ensuring that teams follow consistent and effective design principles, meet regulatory and compliance requirements, and improve the overall quality and maintainability of the system.

### Vision
The “Golden Path” is a set of well-defined, repeatable best practices that guide developers and designers in key areas such as security, accessibility, and translation. By following these paths, future design efforts will maintain consistency, reduce errors, ensure compliance with security and accessibility standards, and provide an optimized user experience across different regions and languages.

### Background
Currently, teams may lack a consistent reference for key design considerations like security, accessibility, and translation. Without clear guidelines, design and implementation can be inconsistent, leading to potential security vulnerabilities, accessibility issues, and poor user experience for international users. Documenting a 'Golden Path' ensures that all teams follow the same standards and that design tasks are executed in a consistent, secure, and scalable manner.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to create and document “Golden Path” guidelines for core design considerations such as Security, UI Accessibility, and UI Translation. These guidelines will be used as a reference for future design tasks to ensure consistency, improve system quality, and meet compliance requirements.

## Details
### 1. Define the Scope of the “Golden Path”
Each Golden Path will focus on one key area and provide detailed guidelines for design and implementation. The areas covered include:

- **Security**: Best practices for securing the application, including authentication, authorization, encryption, secure data handling, and compliance with security regulations.
- **UI Accessibility**: Guidelines to ensure that the UI is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast.
- **UI Translation**: Best practices for ensuring that the user interface can be easily translated and localized, including guidelines for language file management, dynamic content adaptation, and UI layouts that support different languages.
- **Other Design Areas**: These may include performance optimization, UX consistency, or data privacy guidelines, depending on project needs.

### 2. Create the Golden Path for Each Area
#### **Security Golden Path**
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Use industry-standard protocols such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML for authentication.
  - Ensure least privilege access control (role-based access control - RBAC).
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions or privileged user accounts.
- **Data Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using TLS/SSL) and at rest.
  - Use a robust key management system (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault) for handling encryption keys.
- **Secure Data Handling**:
  - Store sensitive data such as passwords using secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2).
  - Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., credit card details) in logs or local storage.
- **Compliance**:
  - Ensure compliance with security frameworks such as ISO 27001, GDPR, or HIPAA.
  - Document and regularly review security audits and vulnerability scans.

#### **UI Accessibility Golden Path**
- **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Ensure all interactive UI elements (buttons, links, form fields) have proper ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels and roles.
  - Provide alternative text for images and media content.
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Ensure all elements can be navigated and interacted with using the keyboard alone (i.e., avoid using mouse-dependent actions).
  - Use logical tab order for interactive elements.
- **Color Contrast**:
  - Ensure text-to-background color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 minimum standards (e.g., contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text).
- **Scalability**:
  - Ensure that the UI remains functional and accessible when zoomed or resized (responsive design).

#### **UI Translation Golden Path**
- **Separation of Content**:
  - Store all translatable strings in external files (e.g., JSON, YAML) to avoid hardcoding strings into the UI.
- **Dynamic Content Adaptation**:
  - Use localization libraries (e.g., i18n, gettext) to handle language switching dynamically.
  - Ensure that date, time, and numeric formats are localized based on the user’s locale.
- **Flexible Layouts**:
  - Design UI components that adapt to different language lengths (e.g., supporting longer German words or right-to-left languages like Arabic).
- **Testing**:
  - Test translated UIs for layout and content overflow issues across different languages.

### 3. Document the Golden Path
- **Structure**:
  Each Golden Path document should be structured clearly, starting with an introduction that explains the importance of the topic, followed by detailed best practices, and ending with specific examples and references.

  Example format:
  1. **Introduction**: Explain the importance of security/accessibility/translation.
  2. **Best Practices**: Provide detailed guidelines on each area (e.g., encryption, ARIA labels, string management).
  3. **Examples**: Provide code snippets or UI examples that demonstrate the correct implementation of each guideline.
  4. **References**: Link to external resources, compliance frameworks, or further reading (e.g., WCAG, OWASP, ISO standards).

- **Storage and Accessibility**:
  - Store the Golden Path documents in a central repository that is accessible to all team members (e.g., a shared Confluence space, GitHub repository, or internal wiki).
  - Ensure that the documents are easy to navigate, searchable, and updated regularly as standards or project requirements evolve.

### 4. Train and Communicate the Golden Path
- **Training Sessions**: Conduct training sessions or workshops for the development, design, and QA teams to familiarize them with the Golden Path guidelines.
- **Integration in Design Reviews**: Ensure that the Golden Path is integrated into design review processes. Every future design task should reference the relevant Golden Path and adhere to the documented guidelines.
- **Documentation Updates**: Set a process for regularly reviewing and updating the Golden Path documentation to incorporate new industry standards or project-specific changes.

### Testing
- **Compliance Checks**:
  - Use automated tools (e.g., Lighthouse for accessibility audits, security vulnerability scanners) to ensure compliance with the Golden Path guidelines during development.
  - Test multilingual UIs across different languages to ensure proper translation and layout handling.

- **Code Reviews**:
  - During code reviews, validate that the implementation follows the Security, UI Accessibility, and UI Translation Golden Path guidelines.

- **User Testing**:
  - Conduct user testing with real users, including those with disabilities, to ensure accessibility compliance.

### External Dependencies
- Access to external security frameworks and standards (e.g., OWASP, WCAG).
- Collaboration with the development, design, and security teams to define best practices and validate the implementation of guidelines.
- Tools for testing accessibility (e.g., Lighthouse), translation (i18n libraries), and security (vulnerability scanning tools).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have defined and documented the Golden Path for Security, UI Accessibility, and UI Translation.
- Should have stored the Golden Path documentation in a central, accessible repository.
- Should have conducted training sessions to familiarize the team with the Golden Path guidelines.
- Should have integrated the Golden Path into design review processes, ensuring future designs adhere to these guidelines.
- Should have set up automated and manual testing processes to validate compliance with the Golden Path during development.

### Gherkin
