# Verify maximum concurrency meets service requirements for all ECS services
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to verify that the maximum concurrency for all  Elastic Container Service (ECS) services meets the service requirements, **So That** we can ensure optimal performance, handle peak loads effectively, and maintain service reliability and responsiveness.

This story focuses on evaluating the current concurrency settings for ECS services to ensure they align with the application's performance requirements and expected user load. By verifying and adjusting these settings as needed, we aim to prevent performance degradation, service outages, and ensure the system can handle varying workloads efficiently.

### Vision
Verifying the maximum concurrency for ECS services is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and preventing service disruptions. By ensuring that ECS services are configured to handle the expected concurrency levels, we can effectively manage resource allocation, reduce latency, and ensure a seamless user experience, even during peak load times.

### Background
Currently, the concurrency settings for ECS services may not be fully optimized or may not align with the service requirements, potentially leading to performance issues during high-traffic periods. Without verifying these settings, there is a risk of overloading the services, resulting in degraded performance, increased latency, or even service outages.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to verify and adjust, if necessary, the maximum concurrency for all ECS services to ensure they meet the service requirements. This initiative aims to optimize performance, enhance resource utilization, and maintain the reliability and responsiveness of the application.

## Details
1. **Identify Service Requirements**:
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to identify the expected load and performance requirements for each ECS service, including peak traffic periods and average user concurrency levels.
    - Determine the concurrency limits needed for each service to handle the expected load without performance degradation or service interruptions.

2. **Review Current ECS Configurations**:
    - Review the current ECS task definitions and service configurations to identify the maximum concurrency settings, such as the number of tasks, CPU and memory allocation, and scaling policies.
    - Identify any discrepancies between the current settings and the identified service requirements, including potential bottlenecks or resource constraints.

3. **Adjust Maximum Concurrency Settings**:
    - Adjust the concurrency settings for each ECS service to match the service requirements, including updating task definitions, scaling policies, and resource allocation.
    - Configure ECS service auto-scaling based on metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics to dynamically adjust the number of tasks and maintain optimal performance during varying load conditions.
    - Implement throttling or rate limiting mechanisms if necessary to control the rate of incoming requests and prevent overloading the services.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Perform load testing on the updated ECS services to validate that they can handle the expected concurrency levels without performance degradation or service outages.
    - Monitor key performance metrics such as response times, CPU and memory utilization, and task counts to ensure that the services are performing as expected under different load conditions.
    - Validate that auto-scaling policies are functioning correctly, scaling the services up or down in response to changing demand.

5. **Monitor and Optimize**:
    - Set up ongoing monitoring to track the concurrency levels and performance of ECS services in production, using tools like AWS CloudWatch to capture metrics and trends.
    - Continuously review and optimize the concurrency settings based on observed performance and changes in service requirements to ensure that the services remain responsive and reliable.

### Testing
- Conduct load testing using tools such as Apache JMeter or AWS Distributed Load Testing to simulate peak traffic and validate the maximum concurrency settings.
- Monitor the ECS services during load testing to ensure that they scale appropriately and maintain desired performance levels, including response times and resource utilization.
- Validate that the services can handle the peak concurrency levels without experiencing performance degradation, errors, or timeouts.
- Review the scaling behavior of ECS services to ensure that auto-scaling policies are correctly adjusting the number of tasks based on demand.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the ECS service configurations and task definitions for review and adjustment of concurrency settings.
- Integration with load testing and monitoring tools (e.g., Apache JMeter, AWS CloudWatch) for testing and validating the concurrency settings.
- Collaboration with development and operations teams to define service requirements and validate the performance of ECS services under varying loads.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified the expected load and performance requirements for each ECS service, including peak concurrency levels.
- Should have reviewed and adjusted the maximum concurrency settings for all ECS services to meet the identified service requirements.
- Should have performed load testing to validate that the services can handle the expected concurrency levels without performance degradation.
- Should have set up monitoring to track the performance and concurrency levels of ECS services in production, ensuring ongoing optimization.
- Should have documented the changes made to ECS configurations and the results of the testing and validation process.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Reviewing and Adjusting Maximum Concurrency for ECS Services
Given the identification of service requirements,
When the maximum concurrency settings for ECS services are reviewed,
Then they should be adjusted to align with the expected load and performance requirements.

#### Scenario: Load Testing and Validation of ECS Concurrency Settings
Given the adjustment of ECS service concurrency settings,
When load testing is performed,
Then the ECS services should handle the peak concurrency levels without performance degradation or service outages.

#### Scenario: Monitoring ECS Services for Ongoing Optimization
Given the implementation of monitoring for ECS services,
When the services are running in production,
Then they should be continuously monitored to ensure they maintain optimal performance and responsiveness under varying load conditions.
