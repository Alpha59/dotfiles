# Identify and create basic UI testing tool and framework
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Engineer, **I want** to identify and create a basic UI testing tool and framework, **So That** we can ensure that the user interface (UI) functions correctly and consistently, preventing regressions and improving the quality of the user experience.

This story focuses on selecting a suitable UI testing tool and developing a basic framework that enables automated testing of UI components. The goal is to ensure that UI functionality is validated during development and deployment, catching issues early and preventing broken UI elements from reaching production.

### Vision
By identifying and creating a basic UI testing tool and framework, we can automate the validation of UI elements, user interactions, and overall user experience. This approach helps reduce the manual effort required for UI testing, ensures consistency across different test cases, and enables the team to quickly identify UI issues caused by code changes or feature updates.

### Background
Currently, there may be limited or inconsistent UI testing, leading to potential issues with UI functionality going unnoticed until after deployment. Implementing a basic UI testing tool and framework provides an automated and structured way to test the UI, ensuring that critical user interactions and UI elements are tested regularly to prevent regressions.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to identify a suitable UI testing tool and create a basic framework for automated UI testing. This initiative aims to enhance the overall quality of the user experience by catching UI issues early in the development cycle and reducing the likelihood of broken UI elements being deployed to production.

## Details
1. **Identify a Suitable UI Testing Tool**:
    - Research and evaluate available UI testing tools that align with the project’s technology stack and requirements. Popular options include:
      - **Selenium**: A widely-used open-source tool for automating browsers, supporting multiple programming languages.
      - **Cypress**: A fast and modern UI testing tool with an intuitive API and built-in features for handling asynchronous code.
      - **Puppeteer**: A headless browser automation tool designed for testing and interacting with web applications, particularly useful for Chrome.
      - **Playwright**: An open-source automation tool similar to Puppeteer, offering cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit).
    - Consider factors such as ease of setup, compatibility with existing CI/CD pipelines, support for different browsers, and community support.

2. **Set Up the Testing Tool**:
    - Install and configure the chosen UI testing tool in the project’s codebase, ensuring that it is compatible with the existing development environment.
    - Integrate the tool with the development workflow, including setting up necessary dependencies and configuring test scripts to run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Create Basic UI Test Cases**:
    - Develop basic UI test cases that validate critical UI components and interactions. These should include:
      - **Smoke Tests**: Basic tests that ensure the main pages of the application load correctly and key elements (e.g., headers, footers, buttons) are present.
      - **Functional Tests**: Validate user interactions with key components such as form submissions, button clicks, and navigation.
      - **Visual Tests**: Ensure that important UI components are rendered correctly and have the expected styling.
      - **Cross-Browser Tests**: Test the UI across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure consistent functionality.
    - Example test scenarios:
      - Ensure that the login form is present and functions correctly.
      - Validate that users can navigate between pages using the navigation bar.
      - Confirm that form inputs can be successfully submitted and that validation messages are displayed correctly.

4. **Integrate UI Testing into the CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run the UI tests during the build and deployment process, ensuring that the tests are executed on every code change.
    - Set up the pipeline to provide feedback on test results, including pass/fail statuses and detailed logs of any failed tests.
    - Configure alerts or notifications for the team in case of test failures, ensuring that UI issues are addressed promptly.

5. **Document the Testing Framework**:
    - Document the setup process for the UI testing tool and framework, including installation instructions, test script examples, and usage guidelines.
    - Provide guidelines for writing new UI tests, including best practices for maintaining test cases and organizing test scripts.
    - Ensure that developers and QA engineers are familiar with the tool and framework, and provide training if necessary.

6. **Expand the Framework Over Time**:
    - Start with basic UI test cases and gradually expand the framework to cover more complex UI interactions and edge cases.
    - Add more test cases as new features are developed, ensuring that every new UI component is tested before release.
    - Consider adding additional types of tests, such as accessibility testing and performance testing, to further enhance the coverage of the UI tests.

### Testing
- Execute the basic UI test cases in a test or staging environment to ensure that they correctly validate key UI components and interactions.
- Test the integration of the UI testing tool into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that tests are automatically triggered and that results are reported accurately.
- Simulate different browsers and devices to validate cross-browser compatibility and ensure that the UI behaves consistently across platforms.
- Monitor the test results over multiple runs to ensure that the tests are stable, reliable, and provide useful feedback to the development team.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to manage the test scripts and ensure they are part of the development workflow.
- Access to a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI) to automate the execution of UI tests during the build and deployment process.
- Collaboration with the development and QA teams to identify critical UI components and interactions that need to be tested.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and set up a suitable UI testing tool that is compatible with the project’s technology stack.
- Should have created a basic UI testing framework with test cases that validate key UI components and interactions.
- Should have integrated the UI tests into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that tests are automatically executed and results are reported.
- Should have documented the setup process and guidelines for maintaining and expanding the UI testing framework.
- Should have validated the framework by executing the tests in a staging environment and confirming that they provide accurate results.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Setting Up a Basic UI Testing Tool
Given the identification of a suitable UI testing tool,
When the tool is installed and configured,
Then it should be integrated with the project’s codebase and ready for writing UI test cases.

#### Scenario: Running UI Tests in the CI/CD Pipeline
Given the integration of UI tests into the CI/CD pipeline,
When the pipeline is triggered by a new code commit,
Then the UI tests should be executed automatically, and the results should be reported to the team.

#### Scenario: Validating Key UI Components and Interactions
Given a set of basic UI test cases,
When the tests are executed,
Then the UI components and interactions should be validated, and any failures should be reported for further investigation.
