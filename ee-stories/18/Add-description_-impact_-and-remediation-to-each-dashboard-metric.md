# Add description, impact, and remediation to each dashboard metric
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to add descriptions, impact, and remediation steps to each metric on the availability monitoring dashboard, **So That** the team can quickly understand the meaning of each metric, assess the potential impact of issues, and take the appropriate remediation steps to resolve them.

This story focuses on improving the usability of the availability monitoring dashboard by adding detailed descriptions, impact assessments, and remediation guidelines for each key metric. This information helps the operations and development teams understand the context of an alert or issue, its potential impact on the system, and the actions required to resolve the issue efficiently.

### Vision
Adding descriptions, impact, and remediation steps to each metric on the monitoring dashboard ensures that teams can interpret the metrics quickly and accurately, reducing the time spent diagnosing issues and determining the best course of action. This added context improves incident response times and helps prevent small issues from escalating into larger problems.

### Background
Currently, the availability monitoring dashboard may lack detailed explanations for each metric, leaving team members to interpret the metrics on their own. Without clear descriptions, it can be difficult to assess the severity of an issue or understand the appropriate steps to resolve it. Providing this information on the dashboard helps teams make informed decisions more quickly and improves overall system reliability.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to enhance the availability monitoring dashboard by adding clear descriptions of each metric, the potential impact of any issues detected by that metric, and detailed remediation steps. This initiative aims to improve the efficiency of incident response and ensure that teams can resolve issues quickly and effectively.

## Details
1. **Add Descriptions to Each Metric**:
    - For each metric on the availability monitoring dashboard, provide a detailed description that explains:
      - **What the metric measures**: For example, 'API response time measures the time it takes for the system to respond to API requests.'
      - **How the metric is calculated**: For example, 'Response times are calculated as the average time taken for requests to be processed by the server.'
      - **Why the metric is important**: For example, 'Tracking API response times is critical for ensuring that users experience fast and responsive service.'
    - Ensure that the descriptions are clear and concise, making it easy for team members to understand what each metric represents.

2. **Assess the Potential Impact of Issues**:
    - For each metric, include a description of the potential impact on the system or customers if the metric falls outside of acceptable thresholds. For example:
      - **API Response Time**: 'If API response times exceed 200ms, users may experience delays when interacting with the system, leading to a poor user experience.'
      - **Database Query Success Rate**: 'If the success rate of database queries falls below 99%, data retrieval and storage operations may fail, potentially causing data inconsistency or loss.'
      - **Service Uptime**: 'If uptime falls below 99.9%, customers may experience service outages, which could lead to dissatisfaction and financial penalties for violating SLAs.'
    - These impact statements help the team quickly assess the severity of an issue and prioritize the response accordingly.

3. **Provide Remediation Guidelines for Each Metric**:
    - For each metric, add remediation steps that team members can follow to resolve issues when an alert is triggered. For example:
      - **API Response Time**:
        - **Step 1**: Check the load on the API server and determine if traffic levels are unusually high.
        - **Step 2**: Investigate if any recent code changes or deployments may have introduced performance bottlenecks.
        - **Step 3**: Scale the service horizontally by adding more API server instances to handle increased traffic.
      - **Database Query Success Rate**:
        - **Step 1**: Review database logs for errors or timeouts that may indicate issues with query performance.
        - **Step 2**: Optimize database queries to improve performance and reduce load on the database server.
        - **Step 3**: Check database resource utilization (CPU, memory) and scale resources if necessary.
      - **Service Uptime**:
        - **Step 1**: Verify that all necessary services and dependencies are running and operational.
        - **Step 2**: Check for network issues or service interruptions that could be affecting uptime.
        - **Step 3**: Restart any failed services or reroute traffic to healthy instances.
    - These remediation steps provide clear guidance to the team, reducing the time it takes to resolve issues and minimizing downtime.

4. **Integrate Descriptions, Impact, and Remediation into the Dashboard**:
    - Ensure that the descriptions, impact statements, and remediation steps are visible within the monitoring dashboard, either as tooltips or as part of the dashboard layout.
    - For each metric, provide a way for users to easily access this information without needing to leave the dashboard (e.g., hovering over the metric displays a tooltip with the description, impact, and remediation steps).
    - Ensure that the information is concise but provides enough detail to be actionable.

5. **Review and Update Regularly**:
    - Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the descriptions, impact assessments, and remediation steps as the system evolves. For example:
      - As new services or dependencies are added, ensure that their metrics are properly documented and that the impact and remediation guidelines are updated.
      - Review past incidents to identify areas where the current documentation may be lacking or where additional remediation steps are needed.
    - Gather feedback from the team to ensure that the documentation provided on the dashboard remains useful and up to date.

### Testing
- Test the integration of the descriptions, impact statements, and remediation steps into the monitoring dashboard to ensure that they are displayed correctly and are easy to access.
- Simulate different alert scenarios and verify that the descriptions and remediation steps provided on the dashboard are clear, actionable, and helpful for resolving the issue.
- Gather feedback from the operations and engineering teams to ensure that the descriptions and remediation steps are understandable and useful during incident response.
- Monitor the system over time to ensure that the impact assessments remain accurate as service usage patterns change.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog, AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus) to add descriptions, impact statements, and remediation steps to each metric.
- Collaboration with the development and operations teams to gather input on the appropriate remediation steps for resolving issues detected by each metric.
- Integration with incident response tools (e.g., PagerDuty) to ensure that alerts include actionable information from the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have added clear descriptions for each metric on the availability monitoring dashboard, explaining what the metric measures and why it is important.
- Should have documented the potential impact of issues for each metric, helping the team understand the severity of any problems detected by the monitoring system.
- Should have provided detailed remediation steps for each metric, giving the team clear guidance on how to resolve issues when alerts are triggered.
