# Plan and Document adequate customer support mechanisms and escalation paths
### Summary
**As a** Customer Support Manager, **I want** to plan and document adequate customer support mechanisms and escalation paths, **So That** we can provide timely and effective assistance to customers, resolve issues efficiently, and ensure customer satisfaction while maintaining service quality.

This story focuses on establishing a comprehensive customer support framework that includes various support channels, clear escalation paths, and defined response and resolution times. By documenting these mechanisms, we aim to ensure that customer inquiries and issues are handled promptly, with a clear process for escalation when needed, to maintain a high level of customer service.

### Vision
Providing well-defined customer support mechanisms and escalation paths ensures that customers receive consistent, timely, and effective support. This structured approach enables the support team to address customer concerns efficiently, escalate complex issues appropriately, and maintain a positive customer experience. By documenting these processes, we set clear expectations for customers and the support team, fostering trust and satisfaction.

### Background
Currently, the lack of a structured customer support process or unclear escalation paths can lead to delays in issue resolution, customer frustration, and a negative impact on customer satisfaction. Implementing a comprehensive support framework with clear escalation paths is essential to ensure that customer issues are handled effectively and that the support team is equipped to escalate and resolve complex problems.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to plan and document customer support mechanisms and escalation paths, ensuring that customers have access to reliable support channels and that issues are escalated and resolved efficiently. This initiative aims to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline support processes, and maintain high service standards.

## Details
1. **Define Support Channels**:
    - Identify the support channels available to customers, such as email, phone, live chat, and a self-service portal.
    - Determine the availability and scope of each channel, including operating hours, the type of support provided (e.g., technical, billing), and response time expectations.
    - Implement a ticketing system to centralize and track customer inquiries across all support channels, ensuring efficient management and resolution.

2. **Establish Response and Resolution Times**:
    - Define standard response times for initial customer contact across each support channel (e.g., 24 hours for email, immediate for live chat).
    - Set resolution time targets based on the severity and complexity of the issue, categorizing issues as low, medium, or high priority.
    - Communicate these response and resolution time expectations to customers and support staff to set clear guidelines.

3. **Develop Escalation Paths**:
    - Create a structured escalation process for handling complex or high-priority issues that cannot be resolved by the first-line support team.
    - Define escalation tiers, including the roles and responsibilities of each tier (e.g., Tier 1 for basic inquiries, Tier 2 for technical support, Tier 3 for critical issues).
    - Document the criteria for escalating an issue to each tier, including conditions that warrant immediate escalation (e.g., system outages, security breaches).

4. **Document Support and Escalation Procedures**:
    - Create a comprehensive support guide that outlines the procedures for handling customer inquiries, including how to use the ticketing system, log issues, and track progress.
    - Include detailed escalation paths in the documentation, specifying when and how to escalate issues, who to contact at each tier, and the expected response and resolution times.
    - Provide troubleshooting guides and FAQs for common issues to empower the support team and customers with self-service resources.

5. **Training and Review**:
    - Train the customer support team on the documented support mechanisms and escalation paths to ensure they are familiar with the procedures and can apply them effectively.
    - Conduct regular reviews of the support process and escalation paths to identify areas for improvement and ensure they remain effective and relevant.

### Testing
- Simulate various customer support scenarios, including basic inquiries and complex issues, to test the effectiveness of the support mechanisms and escalation paths.
- Review response and resolution times during the simulation to ensure they align with the defined targets and provide timely support to customers.
- Validate the ticketing system's ability to track and manage customer inquiries across different channels, including the escalation process.
- Gather feedback from the support team and customers on the effectiveness of the support mechanisms and make adjustments as necessary.

### External Dependencies
- Implementation and configuration of a ticketing system for managing customer inquiries and tracking issues.
- Access to communication tools and platforms for each support channel (e.g., email, live chat, phone system).
- Collaboration with the support team and other departments to define escalation criteria and procedures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have defined and documented the support channels available to customers, including their scope, availability, and response time expectations.
- Should have established response and resolution time targets for different types of issues and communicated them to the support team and customers.
- Should have developed a structured escalation process with clear paths and criteria for escalating issues to higher support tiers.
- Should have documented the support and escalation procedures in a comprehensive guide, including troubleshooting resources and FAQs.
- Should have trained the support team on the documented procedures and validated the effectiveness of the support mechanisms through testing.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Handling Customer Inquiries through Support Channels
Given the availability of multiple support channels,
When a customer submits an inquiry,
Then the support team should respond within the defined response time and follow the documented procedures to resolve the issue.

#### Scenario: Escalating Complex Issues
Given the implementation of an escalation process,
When a support issue meets the criteria for escalation,
Then the support team should escalate the issue to the appropriate tier, following the documented escalation path and criteria.

#### Scenario: Documenting and Training on Support Procedures
Given the development of support and escalation documentation,
When the support team is trained on the procedures,
Then they should be able to apply the documented processes effectively to handle and escalate customer inquiries.
