# Document and clarify BI requirements, create ticket SLA and procedure, clarify project scoping requirements
### Summary
**As a** Business Intelligence (BI) Manager, **I want** to document and clarify BI requirements, establish a ticket SLA (Service Level Agreement) and procedure, and define clear project scoping requirements, **So That** we can ensure efficient handling of BI requests, set clear expectations for stakeholders, and streamline the delivery of BI solutions.

This story focuses on establishing a well-defined process for handling BI requests, including documenting BI requirements, setting up a ticket SLA, and clarifying project scoping. By doing so, we aim to improve communication, provide clarity on timelines, and enhance the overall efficiency of BI project execution.

### Vision
By documenting and clarifying BI requirements, setting up a ticket SLA, and defining project scoping procedures, we provide a structured approach to handling BI requests. This ensures that stakeholders have clear expectations, requests are processed efficiently, and the BI team can deliver insights in a timely manner. A clear process also reduces confusion, minimizes delays, and improves the quality of the delivered BI solutions.

### Background
Currently, there may be ambiguity around the BI request process, leading to inconsistent handling of tickets, unclear timelines, and incomplete project scopes. Without clear BI requirements and project scoping, the BI team may struggle to deliver accurate and timely insights. Establishing a formal process ensures that requests are managed effectively and that both the BI team and stakeholders have a clear understanding of expectations.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to document and clarify BI requirements, create a ticket SLA with defined response and resolution times, and establish clear project scoping requirements. This initiative aims to improve the efficiency of BI operations, ensure timely delivery of insights, and provide stakeholders with a transparent and well-structured process for submitting and tracking BI requests.

## Details
1. **Document BI Requirements**:
    - Create a standard template for stakeholders to use when submitting BI requests. This should include key details such as:
      - **Objective**: What is the goal or business question the BI request aims to address?
      - **Data Requirements**: What data sources or specific datasets are needed to fulfill the request?
      - **Metrics/KPIs**: What specific metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) are being requested or tracked?
      - **Timeframe**: Is there a deadline for delivering the BI solution? Is the request urgent or routine?
    - Ensure the template captures all relevant details to avoid ambiguity and provide the BI team with the information they need to execute the request efficiently.
    - Provide examples of well-formed BI requests and ensure that stakeholders understand how to properly document their needs.

2. **Create Ticket SLA and Procedure**:
    - Define a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for BI tickets, including:
      - **Response Time**: The maximum time the BI team will take to acknowledge the ticket (e.g., 1 business day for standard requests).
      - **Resolution Time**: The expected time to resolve the request based on its priority (e.g., high-priority tickets within 3 business days, routine tickets within 7 business days).
      - **Prioritization Criteria**: Define how tickets are prioritized based on factors such as business impact, urgency, and complexity.
    - Establish a clear ticket procedure, including:
      - **Submission**: How stakeholders should submit tickets (e.g., through a helpdesk system or BI team portal).
      - **Tracking**: How stakeholders can track the status of their requests (e.g., ticketing system updates or notifications).
      - **Communication**: Guidelines for communication between the BI team and stakeholders during the ticket resolution process, including periodic status updates.

3. **Clarify Project Scoping Requirements**:
    - Define clear project scoping guidelines to ensure that larger BI projects are well-defined before execution. This should include:
      - **Scope of Work**: Clearly outline what the project will cover, including deliverables, timelines, and the data to be used.
      - **Stakeholder Involvement**: Define the roles of stakeholders in the project, including who will be responsible for providing data, validating results, and making decisions.
      - **Dependencies**: Identify any dependencies, such as data from other teams, software tools, or access to specific systems.
      - **Risk Assessment**: Document potential risks to the project, such as data quality issues, limited resources, or changing business requirements.
      - **Sign-Off Process**: Establish a process for stakeholders to sign off on project scope and deliverables before execution begins, ensuring alignment and preventing scope creep.

4. **Implementation and Training**:
    - Implement the new BI request documentation process, ticket SLA, and project scoping requirements across the team and communicate the changes to stakeholders.
    - Provide training for both the BI team and stakeholders on how to submit, track, and scope BI requests using the new process.
    - Ensure that all documentation is readily accessible, and offer examples or case studies to illustrate how the new processes work in practice.

5. **Ongoing Review and Optimization**:
    - Set up a process for regularly reviewing the ticket SLA, project scoping guidelines, and BI request documentation to ensure they remain effective and relevant.
    - Gather feedback from stakeholders and the BI team to identify areas for improvement or refinement in the process.
    - Continuously optimize the process based on feedback, changes in business needs, or new tools and technologies.

### Testing
- Test the new BI request template by having stakeholders submit sample requests and reviewing them with the BI team to ensure they capture all necessary information.
- Simulate the ticketing process with different types of BI requests (e.g., urgent vs. routine) to validate that the SLA and prioritization criteria are working as expected.
- Run a pilot project using the new scoping guidelines to ensure that all aspects of the project, from scope to stakeholder involvement, are well-defined and aligned with the business objectives.
- Monitor the efficiency of the new processes by tracking ticket resolution times, stakeholder satisfaction, and the quality of BI deliverables.

### External Dependencies
- Access to a ticketing system (e.g., JIRA, ServiceNow) to manage BI requests and track their status.
- Collaboration with stakeholders across departments to define BI requirements, prioritize requests, and align on project scopes.
- Tools for data analysis and visualization (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to ensure the BI team can efficiently process requests and deliver insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a standardized template for documenting BI requirements that captures all necessary details for fulfilling requests.
- Should have a defined ticket SLA with response and resolution times, as well as prioritization criteria for handling BI requests.
- Should have clear project scoping guidelines that define the scope, stakeholders, dependencies, and risks for larger BI projects.
- Should have provided training for the BI team and stakeholders on the new processes for submitting, tracking, and scoping BI requests.
- Should have implemented the new processes across the team and tested them for efficiency, accuracy, and stakeholder satisfaction.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Submitting a BI Request Using the New Template
Given the creation of a new BI request template,
When a stakeholder submits a request,
Then the request should contain all necessary details, including objectives, data requirements, and timeframe, for the BI team to execute the request.

#### Scenario: Handling a High-Priority BI Request According to the SLA
Given the implementation of a ticket SLA,
When a high-priority BI request is submitted,
Then the BI team should respond within the defined response time and resolve the request within the agreed resolution time.

#### Scenario: Defining the Scope of a Large BI Project
Given the clarification of project scoping requirements,
When a larger BI project is initiated,
Then the project scope should clearly define deliverables, stakeholders, dependencies, and risks before execution begins.
