# Document SLAs and implement metrics and alarms to monitor customer SLA breaches
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to document Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and implement metrics and alarms to monitor potential customer SLA breaches, **So That** we can ensure compliance with performance and availability commitments and take proactive measures to address any SLA violations.

This story focuses on clearly documenting SLAs for customers, setting up metrics to track SLA performance, and configuring alarms to notify the operations team if an SLA breach is likely or has occurred. This will help ensure that services meet customer expectations and allow the team to respond quickly to potential issues, reducing the risk of SLA violations and financial penalties.

### Vision
By documenting SLAs and implementing monitoring tools, we can ensure that customer commitments for uptime, performance, and response times are consistently met. Automated monitoring and alerts provide real-time visibility into SLA performance, allowing the team to take corrective actions before breaches occur, ensuring customer satisfaction, and maintaining service-level obligations.

### Background
Currently, SLAs may be poorly documented or tracked, leading to potential risks of unmonitored SLA violations. Without proper metrics and alarms, it is difficult to ensure that services are meeting the agreed-upon performance and availability targets. By documenting SLAs and implementing real-time monitoring and alerts, the organization can better manage its service commitments and reduce the risk of customer dissatisfaction or financial penalties due to SLA breaches.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to document customer SLAs, define appropriate metrics for monitoring SLA compliance, and set up alarms that notify the team when an SLA breach is imminent or has occurred. This initiative aims to enhance the visibility of service performance, improve response times to potential SLA breaches, and ensure that the team remains compliant with customer agreements.

## Details
1. **Document SLAs**:
    - Work with the product and customer success teams to document the SLAs that have been agreed upon with customers. Common SLA terms may include:
      - **Uptime**: The percentage of time a service is expected to be available (e.g., 99.9% uptime per month).
      - **Response Time**: Maximum allowable response time for service requests (e.g., API response time must be under 300ms for 95% of requests).
      - **Resolution Time**: The time it takes to resolve critical issues (e.g., Sev-1 issues must be resolved within 1 hour).
      - **Error Rates**: Acceptable levels of errors or failures (e.g., less than 0.5% error rate for API requests).
    - Document these SLAs in a central repository that is accessible to all relevant stakeholders, ensuring that the SLAs are clear and measurable.

2. **Define Metrics to Monitor SLAs**:
    - Identify the key metrics that need to be monitored to ensure compliance with SLAs. For example:
      - **Availability/Uptime**: Use metrics such as system health checks, service availability, and instance status.
      - **Latency/Response Time**: Measure response times for key APIs or services to ensure they meet the SLA requirements.
      - **Error Rates**: Track the number of errors (e.g., 4xx and 5xx errors) as a percentage of total requests to ensure the system stays within acceptable error thresholds.
      - **Downtime**: Measure total downtime per service to ensure it stays within the allowable limits defined in the SLA.
    - Set up these metrics in a monitoring tool (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus) to track the performance of each service in real-time.

3. **Configure Alarms for SLA Breaches**:
    - Implement alarms that trigger when service performance is approaching an SLA breach or when a breach occurs. For example:
      - Trigger an alarm if uptime drops below the threshold (e.g., below 99.9% over the past 30 days).
      - Set up an alarm if the API response time exceeds the defined SLA for more than 5% of requests.
      - Trigger an alarm when the error rate exceeds the acceptable threshold defined in the SLA.
    - Ensure that alarms are configured to notify the relevant teams (e.g., via email, Slack, or PagerDuty) when an SLA breach is imminent or has occurred.

4. **Implement Dashboard for SLA Monitoring**:
    - Create a real-time dashboard that displays key SLA metrics and their current status. This should include:
      - **Current Uptime**: Display the current uptime percentage for each critical service.
      - **Response Times**: Show average and percentile (e.g., 95th percentile) response times for APIs and other services.
      - **Error Rates**: Display the current error rates for key services, along with historical trends.
    - Ensure that the dashboard is accessible to all relevant stakeholders, including the operations, engineering, and customer success teams, so that they can monitor SLA performance.

5. **Testing and Validating SLA Monitoring**:
    - Test the monitoring and alerting system by simulating conditions that approach SLA violations. For example:
      - Simulate high latency or downtime to ensure that alarms are triggered correctly.
      - Test alert notifications to ensure that the team is notified in a timely manner when SLA thresholds are exceeded.
    - Validate that all metrics are being correctly tracked and displayed in the dashboard, and that any potential issues are identified and reported in real time.

6. **Document Response Procedures**:
    - Document the procedures for responding to SLA breaches or potential breaches. This should include:
      - **Escalation Paths**: Define how issues should be escalated if an SLA breach is imminent, including the roles and responsibilities of the team.
      - **Communication Protocols**: Define how to communicate SLA breaches to internal stakeholders and customers, including timelines for communication.
      - **Remediation Steps**: Outline the steps that need to be taken to resolve the issue and bring the service back into SLA compliance.
    - Ensure that the team is trained on the response procedures and that they understand their roles in addressing SLA breaches.

7. **Ongoing Monitoring and Optimization**:
    - Continuously monitor the performance of services against the documented SLAs and adjust metrics and alarms as needed to ensure accurate tracking.
    - Review the SLA monitoring process regularly and make improvements to ensure that the system is effective in preventing and detecting breaches.
    - Gather feedback from the operations and customer success teams to ensure that the SLA monitoring system meets their needs and helps them maintain service-level commitments.

### Testing
- Simulate SLA breaches by introducing conditions such as increased latency, error rates, or downtime, and verify that alarms are triggered as expected.
- Test the real-time dashboard to ensure that SLA metrics are accurately displayed and updated, and that the team can access the relevant data.
- Validate that alert notifications are sent to the correct team members when an SLA breach occurs and that the escalation paths are followed correctly.
- Monitor the system for a period of time to ensure that the SLA monitoring and alerting system is functioning as expected in a live environment.

### External Dependencies
- Access to monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, or Prometheus to track and visualize metrics for service performance and availability.
- Collaboration with the product, engineering, and customer success teams to define SLAs, identify key metrics, and implement response procedures.
- Integration with alerting tools such as PagerDuty or Slack to notify the team when SLA thresholds are breached.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have documented the SLAs for key services, including uptime, response times, error rates, and resolution times.
- Should have defined and implemented metrics to monitor SLA performance in real-time using appropriate monitoring tools.
- Should have configured alarms that notify the operations team when SLA breaches are imminent or have occurred.
- Should have set up a dashboard to display key SLA metrics, allowing stakeholders to monitor service performance continuously.
- Should have tested the SLA monitoring system, ensuring that alarms and notifications are triggered appropriately and that response procedures are in place.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Monitoring SLA Uptime
Given a service with an uptime SLA,
When the uptime percentage drops below the SLA threshold,
Then an alarm should be triggered, and the operations team should be notified.

#### Scenario: Monitoring SLA Response Times
Given a service with a response time SLA,
When the average response time exceeds the defined threshold for more than 5% of requests,
Then an alarm should be triggered, and the operations team should investigate the issue.

#### Scenario: Testing SLA Alarms and Alerts
Given the implementation of SLA monitoring alarms,
When a simulated SLA breach occurs (e.g., increased latency or downtime),
Then the system should trigger an alarm, notify the team, and display the issue on the SLA dashboard.
