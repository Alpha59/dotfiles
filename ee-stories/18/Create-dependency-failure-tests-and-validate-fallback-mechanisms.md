# Create dependency failure tests and validate fallback mechanisms
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Engineer, **I want** to create dependency failure tests and validate fallback mechanisms, **So That** we can ensure that the system behaves as expected during dependency failures and that the fallback mechanisms are functioning correctly to maintain service continuity and user experience.

This story focuses on simulating dependency failures within the system (e.g., third-party services, databases, APIs) and validating that the fallback mechanisms, such as retries, timeouts, and alternative service calls, are correctly implemented and operational. The goal is to ensure the system remains robust and reliable even when critical dependencies fail.

### Vision
By creating dependency failure tests and validating fallback mechanisms, we ensure the system's resilience against failures in external services or internal dependencies. These tests will help prevent service disruptions, improve user experience, and reduce downtime by validating that appropriate fallback actions are taken in failure scenarios, such as using alternative services or displaying graceful error messages.

### Background
Without testing the failure scenarios of dependencies and validating fallback mechanisms, the system may be vulnerable to unexpected service disruptions when critical services or APIs fail. Fallback mechanisms, such as retries or alternative service calls, are essential to maintaining uptime and service quality. Creating and validating tests for these mechanisms ensures the system can handle failure scenarios gracefully.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to create tests that simulate dependency failures and validate that fallback mechanisms are working as intended. This initiative aims to improve the resilience of the system, ensure that user experience is not severely impacted by external or internal service failures, and reduce potential downtime.

## Details
1. **Identify Critical Dependencies**:
    - List all critical internal and external dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs, databases, internal microservices) that need to be tested for failure scenarios.
    - Categorize dependencies by their criticality and the impact they have on the system if they fail (e.g., high, medium, low).
    - Identify the fallback mechanisms implemented for each dependency, such as retries, circuit breakers, alternative services, or caching.

2. **Define Failure Scenarios**:
    - Define the failure scenarios to be tested for each critical dependency, such as timeouts, service unavailability, rate-limiting, or data corruption.
    - Define failure thresholds (e.g., maximum retries before fallback is triggered) and any fallback paths (e.g., using cached data, switching to a backup service).

3. **Implement Dependency Failure Tests**:
    - Develop automated tests that simulate failure scenarios for each critical dependency, using tools like fault injection, API stubbing, or network partitioning (e.g., Chaos Monkey, Gremlin).
    - Simulate network latency, service unavailability, incorrect responses (e.g., 5xx errors), or slow response times to verify the systemâ€™s response.
    - Validate that the system transitions to the fallback mechanism when the dependency fails.

4. **Validate Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Verify that fallback mechanisms such as retries, circuit breakers, and alternative service calls are triggered correctly during the failure scenarios.
    - Ensure that user experience is minimally affected, such as by providing a graceful degradation or fallback page if necessary.
    - Validate that error messages are logged appropriately for debugging and monitoring purposes.

5. **Monitor System Behavior and Performance**:
    - Monitor system performance and behavior during the failure tests, ensuring that fallback mechanisms do not introduce bottlenecks or unnecessary delays.
    - Track key metrics such as response times, error rates, and retries to ensure that the system remains stable even during dependency failures.
    - Use monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus) to track dependency failures and fallback execution in production environments.

6. **Document Test Results and Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Document the results of the dependency failure tests, highlighting any issues discovered during testing and the effectiveness of the fallback mechanisms.
    - Update the system documentation to clearly explain the fallback paths for each critical dependency, including failure thresholds, expected behavior, and monitoring strategies.
    - Ensure that the development team and stakeholders are aware of the fallback mechanisms and the test results, enabling continuous improvement of system resilience.

### Testing
- Simulate failures for each critical dependency in a test or staging environment to ensure that the fallback mechanisms are triggered and function correctly.
- Verify that the system transitions smoothly to fallback mechanisms without introducing significant performance degradation or affecting the user experience.
- Test with different failure conditions (e.g., slow responses, total unavailability) and validate that retries, circuit breakers, and alternative services behave as expected.
- Measure system metrics such as response times, error rates, and fallback activation to ensure system stability during failure scenarios.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the test environment and dependency services (e.g., APIs, databases) to simulate failure scenarios without impacting production.
- Integration with fault injection tools (e.g., Chaos Monkey, Gremlin) for simulating network and dependency failures.
- Collaboration with the development team to identify dependencies, test failure scenarios, and validate fallback mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and defined failure scenarios for all critical dependencies, including the associated fallback mechanisms.
- Should have developed automated tests that simulate dependency failures and validate that fallback mechanisms are triggered as expected.
- Should have verified that fallback mechanisms such as retries, circuit breakers, and alternative service calls are working correctly.
- Should have documented the test results and updated the system documentation with details on fallback mechanisms and failure scenarios.
- Should have monitored the system's behavior during failure tests to ensure that it remains stable and responsive.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Simulating Dependency Failure and Triggering Fallback
Given the identification of critical dependencies,
When a failure scenario (e.g., timeout or service unavailability) occurs,
Then the system should trigger the appropriate fallback mechanism and maintain service continuity.

#### Scenario: Testing Retry and Circuit Breaker Mechanisms
Given a dependency that supports retries and circuit breakers,
When the dependency fails or returns incorrect responses,
Then the system should retry the request according to the defined retry policy, and activate the circuit breaker if the retries fail.

#### Scenario: Monitoring and Logging Dependency Failures
Given the occurrence of dependency failures,
When the fallback mechanisms are triggered,
Then the system should log the error details, capture metrics, and alert the relevant teams for investigation.
