# Implement latency monitoring for all dependency calls to identify sources of latency issues
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to implement latency monitoring for all dependency calls, **So That** we can identify sources of latency issues and proactively address them to ensure system performance and maintain service-level agreements (SLAs).

This story focuses on implementing monitoring mechanisms to track the latency of dependency calls, such as calls to third-party services, databases, and internal microservices. By monitoring latency, we can detect performance bottlenecks, identify problematic dependencies, and resolve issues before they significantly impact users or the system.

### Vision
Implementing latency monitoring for dependency calls ensures that any delays in communication between services or external systems are detected early. By identifying the sources of latency issues, we can optimize performance, improve user experience, and meet SLAs. Continuous monitoring allows us to respond to emerging latency problems proactively, preventing them from escalating into more significant outages or performance degradation.

### Background
Currently, there may be limited visibility into the performance of dependency calls, making it difficult to identify the source of latency issues that could impact overall system performance. Without a clear understanding of which dependencies are causing delays, it is challenging to troubleshoot and optimize the system effectively. Latency monitoring provides the necessary insights to detect and resolve these issues in real time.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement latency monitoring for all dependency calls, enabling the identification and resolution of latency issues that could negatively affect system performance. This initiative aims to provide visibility into the performance of external and internal dependencies, helping the team address bottlenecks and ensure the system meets its performance objectives.

## Details
1. **Identify Key Dependencies**:
    - Collaborate with development and operations teams to identify the critical dependencies that need to be monitored. These may include:
      - **Third-party APIs**: External services that the system relies on, such as payment gateways or authentication services.
      - **Internal Microservices**: Internal services that communicate with each other within a distributed architecture.
      - **Databases**: Calls to databases or data stores, including queries and write operations.
    - Prioritize high-impact dependencies based on their role in the system and their potential impact on performance.

2. **Define Latency Thresholds**:
    - Establish latency thresholds for each dependency based on the acceptable performance limits for the system. For example:
      - Database queries should return within 100ms.
      - Third-party API responses should be under 200ms.
      - Internal microservice calls should not exceed 50ms.
    - Use these thresholds to trigger alerts when latency exceeds acceptable levels, enabling proactive intervention.

3. **Select Monitoring Tools**:
    - Choose suitable tools to monitor latency, such as:
      - **AWS X-Ray**: Provides end-to-end tracing for AWS services, allowing you to measure the latency of each service call.
      - **Datadog APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**: Tracks the performance of services and monitors latency for external and internal dependencies.
      - **Prometheus and Grafana**: Used for custom latency tracking and visualizing metrics in real-time.
      - **OpenTelemetry**: An open-source tool for distributed tracing and monitoring latency across services.
    - Integrate the selected tools with the system to start tracking latency for each dependency.

4. **Implement Latency Monitoring**:
    - Instrument the codebase to monitor the latency of each dependency call. This may involve:
      - Adding monitoring middleware to capture latency data for API calls, microservice communications, and database queries.
      - Using tracing tools to record the start and end times of each dependency call and calculate the total duration.
    - Ensure that latency data is collected and stored in a central monitoring system (e.g., Datadog, AWS CloudWatch, or Prometheus).

5. **Configure Alerts for Latency Issues**:
    - Set up alerts to notify the operations team when latency exceeds predefined thresholds. For example:
      - Trigger an alert if a third-party API call exceeds 200ms for more than 5 minutes.
      - Set up alerts for internal services if latency consistently exceeds the acceptable limit over multiple calls.
    - Define alert severity levels based on the impact of the latency issue, such as warning alerts for minor delays and critical alerts for severe performance degradation.

6. **Monitor and Analyze Latency Metrics**:
    - Continuously monitor latency metrics in real-time using the monitoring tools' dashboards. Visualize metrics such as:
      - **Average Latency**: The average response time for each dependency over a given period.
      - **Latency Distribution**: The distribution of response times, highlighting any outliers or spikes.
      - **Error Rates**: Correlating latency issues with dependency failures or errors.
    - Analyze historical data to identify patterns or trends, such as recurring latency spikes during peak traffic periods or with specific dependencies.

7. **Optimize Performance Based on Latency Insights**:
    - Investigate the root causes of latency issues by reviewing the collected metrics and tracing data.
    - Work with the development team to optimize the performance of dependencies that consistently show high latency, such as optimizing database queries, refactoring inefficient code, or implementing caching strategies.
    - Collaborate with third-party providers to resolve external API performance issues or adjust retry strategies to handle high-latency responses more gracefully.

### Testing
- Test the latency monitoring implementation by simulating different levels of load on the system to ensure that the monitoring tools capture and report accurate latency data.
- Generate test scenarios where dependency calls experience delays (e.g., introducing artificial latency) to verify that alerts are triggered correctly when thresholds are exceeded.
- Validate that the latency data is being visualized in real-time dashboards and that alert notifications are sent to the appropriate team members.
- Analyze test data to ensure that the latency monitoring tools can identify the specific dependencies causing latency issues.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with latency monitoring tools such as AWS X-Ray, Datadog APM, or OpenTelemetry for capturing and reporting latency metrics.
- Access to internal services, databases, and third-party APIs to implement latency monitoring and instrument the code.
- Collaboration with the development team to optimize code and address any latency issues identified during monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and instrumented all critical dependencies for latency monitoring, including third-party APIs, microservices, and databases.
- Should have implemented monitoring tools to track and visualize latency data for all dependency calls.
- Should have configured alerts that notify the operations team when latency exceeds predefined thresholds, based on the performance requirements.
- Should have validated the effectiveness of the monitoring system by simulating latency issues and confirming that alerts are triggered and reported correctly.
- Should have provided dashboards that display real-time and historical latency metrics, enabling continuous monitoring and analysis.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Monitoring Latency for Dependency Calls
Given the implementation of latency monitoring for dependency calls,
When a dependency call exceeds the defined latency threshold,
Then an alert should be triggered, and the latency issue should be recorded in the monitoring system.

#### Scenario: Simulating Latency Issues for Dependencies
Given the integration of a latency monitoring tool,
When a dependency experiences artificial delays or performance degradation,
Then the monitoring system should capture the increased latency, trigger an alert, and display the issue on the dashboard.

#### Scenario: Analyzing Latency Data and Identifying Sources of Latency
Given the availability of latency metrics in the monitoring tool,
When the system experiences high latency,
Then the operations team should be able to identify the specific dependency causing the issue and investigate the root cause.
