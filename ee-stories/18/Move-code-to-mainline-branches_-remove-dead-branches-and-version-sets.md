# Move code to mainline branches, remove dead branches and version sets
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Engineer, **I want** to move code to mainline branches, remove dead branches, and clean up version sets, **So That** we can maintain a clean, efficient, and well-organized codebase, reduce confusion, and simplify version management.

This story focuses on moving all active and relevant code to the mainline branches, removing unused or outdated branches, and cleaning up old version sets. This initiative ensures that the codebase is well-maintained and reduces the clutter from unused branches, improving the efficiency of future development and reducing the risk of working on outdated code.

### Vision
Moving code to the mainline branches and removing dead branches and version sets helps maintain a streamlined and organized codebase. It ensures that only active and relevant branches are retained, making it easier for developers to work on the most up-to-date code and reducing confusion caused by obsolete branches. Clean version sets ensure that development teams work efficiently, minimizing the risk of errors or regressions.

### Background
Currently, the codebase may contain several unused, outdated, or inactive branches and version sets. This can lead to confusion, clutter, and potential risks, such as developers working on outdated branches or incorrect versions. Regular maintenance of branches and version sets is essential to ensure the codebase remains organized, clean, and ready for future development.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to move all relevant code to the mainline branches, remove any dead or inactive branches, and clean up outdated version sets. This initiative ensures that the codebase remains well-organized and that developers are working on the latest, most relevant code, reducing clutter and improving version management.

## Details
1. **Identify Active and Relevant Branches**:
    - Review the current branches in the repository to identify which branches contain active or in-progress code and need to be retained.
    - Identify mainline branches such as `master` or `main` and other critical branches that should be preserved.
    - Mark any branches that are no longer in use (e.g., old feature branches, bug fix branches, or experimental branches) for removal.

2. **Move Active Code to Mainline Branches**:
    - For any relevant code that is not yet merged into a mainline branch, initiate the process of merging or rebasing the code.
    - Ensure that all necessary reviews and testing are completed before merging to avoid introducing bugs or regressions.
    - Address any merge conflicts or issues that arise during the process to ensure a smooth transition to the mainline branches.

3. **Remove Dead or Inactive Branches**:
    - After ensuring that all relevant code has been moved to the mainline branches, delete any branches that are no longer in use or have become outdated.
    - Verify that no important or unmerged code is lost during this process by thoroughly reviewing the contents of each branch before deletion.
    - Update any related documentation or developer guides to reflect the new branch structure.

4. **Clean Up Version Sets**:
    - Identify any outdated version sets or tags that are no longer relevant or needed.
    - Remove old version sets that are no longer supported or referenced by the team, ensuring that current and active versions remain accessible.
    - Verify that version history is retained for auditing and reference purposes, ensuring that the cleaned-up version sets do not affect the ability to track past releases.

5. **Review and Document Branching Strategy**:
    - Review the current branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, trunk-based development) and document any updates or changes based on the cleanup process.
    - Define clear guidelines for creating, using, and deleting branches to avoid future clutter and ensure consistency across the team.
    - Establish best practices for version management, including when to create new version sets, how to retire old ones, and how to maintain a clean version history.

6. **Communicate Changes to the Team**:
    - Communicate the changes made to the branches and version sets to the development team to ensure everyone is aware of the updated structure.
    - Provide training or guidelines on how to properly manage branches and version sets moving forward, ensuring that developers understand the updated practices.
    - Encourage developers to regularly review their branches and clean up unused code to maintain an organized and efficient codebase.

### Testing
- Test the merging of code into mainline branches by running automated tests to ensure that no new issues or regressions are introduced during the merge.
- Verify that all relevant code from inactive branches is properly merged or rebased into the mainline branches before deleting the branches.
- Confirm that the version history remains intact after cleaning up old version sets and that no critical information or tags are lost.
- Monitor the repository for any issues or errors that arise after the cleanup process, ensuring that all active code is accessible and no unintended consequences occur.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to manage branches, version sets, and perform cleanups.
- Collaboration with the development team to identify active branches, review code for merging, and ensure that no important work is lost.
- Access to automated testing and continuous integration (CI) pipelines to validate the code before merging into mainline branches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have moved all active and relevant code from inactive branches to mainline branches.
- Should have deleted all dead or unused branches after confirming that no important code remains in those branches.
- Should have cleaned up outdated version sets, retaining only the relevant version history and active version sets.
- Should have updated documentation on the branching strategy and version management practices to prevent future clutter.
- Should have communicated the changes and updated practices to the development team to ensure consistency moving forward.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Moving Active Code to Mainline Branches
Given a set of active branches,
When the relevant code is reviewed,
Then all active code should be merged or rebased into the mainline branches.

#### Scenario: Removing Dead Branches
Given the identification of dead or inactive branches,
When the branches are confirmed to be unused,
Then they should be deleted from the repository without losing any relevant code.

#### Scenario: Cleaning Up Version Sets
Given a list of outdated version sets,
When the versions are no longer in use or supported,
Then they should be removed from the repository, ensuring the version history remains intact.
