# Standardize the creation and management of DNS for services and portals.
### Summary
**As a** DevOps Engineer, **I want** to standardize the creation and management of DNS for services and portals, **So That** we can ensure consistent, reliable, and secure access to services while reducing errors and streamlining DNS management across the organization.

This story focuses on establishing standardized processes for creating and managing DNS records for services and portals. By implementing a set of best practices, automation, and clear documentation, we aim to reduce misconfigurations, improve scalability, and ensure that DNS is consistently managed across all environments.

### Vision
Standardizing the creation and management of DNS ensures that services and portals are easily discoverable, securely accessible, and consistently configured. This leads to a reduction in operational overhead, improves the reliability of service access, and mitigates potential issues such as incorrect DNS settings or misconfigurations, which could result in service disruptions.

### Background
Currently, the lack of standardization in the creation and management of DNS records for services and portals can lead to configuration errors, inconsistency, and difficulty in managing DNS at scale. Without a clear process, DNS misconfigurations could result in service outages or access issues. A standardized process helps ensure that DNS management is predictable, scalable, and secure.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to implement standardized processes and best practices for the creation and management of DNS for services and portals. This initiative aims to improve DNS reliability, enhance security, and simplify the management of DNS across different environments.

## Details
1. **Define DNS Naming Conventions**:
    - Establish clear and consistent naming conventions for DNS records that apply to all services and portals, including subdomains, service-specific records, and environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
    - Ensure that naming conventions reflect the structure of the services and provide clarity regarding the serviceâ€™s purpose or environment.
    - Document the naming conventions and ensure that they are enforced across the organization.

2. **Automate DNS Record Creation**:
    - Implement automation for DNS record creation and management using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., AWS Route 53 with Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible).
    - Develop scripts or modules that automatically create DNS records as part of the deployment pipeline, ensuring that DNS management is integrated with service provisioning.
    - Set up approval workflows for DNS changes to ensure security and compliance.

3. **Centralize DNS Management**:
    - Use a centralized DNS management platform (e.g., AWS Route 53, Cloudflare, or Azure DNS) to manage DNS records for all services and portals.
    - Ensure that all DNS changes are logged, auditable, and accessible for future reference.
    - Configure proper access control to DNS management, limiting permissions to authorized personnel and services.

4. **Implement DNS Health Checks and Monitoring**:
    - Set up health checks for critical DNS records (e.g., services and portals) to ensure that they are reachable and resolving correctly.
    - Use monitoring tools (e.g., AWS Route 53 health checks, Datadog) to track DNS resolution performance and detect potential issues, such as DNS downtime or incorrect configurations.
    - Set up alerting to notify the team when DNS issues are detected or if any records are not resolving as expected.

5. **Standardize Record Types and TTLs**:
    - Define standard DNS record types (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.) for services based on their specific use cases and infrastructure setup (e.g., microservices, serverless functions, portals).
    - Establish default Time-To-Live (TTL) values for different record types to balance between DNS performance and flexibility in making changes.
    - Document these standards to ensure consistency across environments.

6. **Security Best Practices for DNS**:
    - Enable DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) for added security and to protect DNS records from spoofing or hijacking.
    - Ensure that all DNS traffic is encrypted where possible, particularly for services exposed to the public internet.
    - Set up monitoring for potential DNS attacks, such as DNS flooding or cache poisoning, and implement mitigation strategies.

7. **Documentation and Training**:
    - Document the entire DNS management process, including naming conventions, automation steps, record types, and troubleshooting guides.
    - Provide training for the DevOps and operations teams to ensure they understand the standardized process and best practices.
    - Establish regular reviews of the DNS management process to ensure it continues to meet organizational needs and scales with growth.

### Testing
- Test the DNS automation by deploying services to different environments and verifying that DNS records are created correctly, using the standardized naming conventions.
- Validate DNS health checks by simulating DNS outages or misconfigurations to ensure the monitoring and alerting systems respond appropriately.
- Test the DNS record creation workflow, including the approval process, to confirm that only authorized changes are allowed.
- Review access controls to DNS management to ensure only authorized users and services have the necessary permissions.

### External Dependencies
- Integration with DNS management tools such as AWS Route 53, Cloudflare, Azure DNS, or others for managing DNS records and monitoring.
- Access to the deployment pipeline for automating DNS record creation using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation.
- Collaboration with security teams to implement DNSSEC and other security best practices for DNS management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have established clear and consistent naming conventions for DNS records across all services and portals.
- Should have automated DNS record creation and management as part of the deployment pipeline using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
- Should have centralized DNS management in a single platform with proper access control and logging.
- Should have set up DNS health checks and monitoring to ensure that DNS records are resolving correctly and that any issues are detected promptly.
- Should have implemented security best practices, including DNSSEC and monitoring for DNS attacks.
- Should have documented the DNS management process and provided training for the relevant teams.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Automating DNS Record Creation
Given the deployment of a new service,
When the service is provisioned,
Then the DNS record for the service should be created automatically using the defined naming conventions and added to the centralized DNS management platform.

#### Scenario: Monitoring DNS Health and Resolution
Given the setup of DNS health checks,
When a DNS record fails to resolve or encounters issues,
Then an alert should be triggered, and the relevant team members should be notified.

#### Scenario: Managing DNS Security
Given the implementation of DNSSEC and monitoring tools,
When a potential DNS attack is detected,
Then the system should take mitigation actions, and alerts should be sent to the security team.
