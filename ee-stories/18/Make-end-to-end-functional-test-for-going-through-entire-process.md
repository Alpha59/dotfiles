# Make end-to-end functional test for going through entire process
### Summary
**As a** Quality Assurance Engineer, **I want** to create an end-to-end functional test for a device going through the entire Fulfillment Center (FC) process, **So That** we can validate the complete workflow, ensure all system components interact correctly, and identify any potential issues before deployment to production.

This story focuses on developing an automated end-to-end test that simulates a device moving through all stages of the FC process. The goal is to verify that each step in the workflow functions as expected and that the system handles the entire process correctly, from receiving the device to completing the final disposition.

### Vision
Creating an end-to-end functional test for the device's journey through the FC process ensures that all components and interactions within the system work seamlessly together. This comprehensive testing approach helps identify any issues or discrepancies in the workflow, allowing for early detection and resolution before the system is deployed to production. By validating the full process, we ensure that the FC system operates reliably and meets business requirements.

### Background
Currently, testing may focus on individual components or stages of the FC process, but without an end-to-end test, there is a risk of overlooking issues that arise from the integration and interaction of these components. Implementing a full end-to-end test provides a holistic view of the system's behavior, helping to ensure that the entire process, from device receipt to final disposition, functions as intended.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to create an end-to-end functional test for a device going through the entire FC process, ensuring that all stages of the workflow are validated and that the system operates correctly as a whole. This initiative aims to enhance system reliability, identify integration issues early, and ensure a smooth process for handling devices within the FC.

## Details
1. **Define the Full FC Process Workflow**:
    - Collaborate with the operations and development teams to outline the entire FC process for a device, including key stages such as receiving, processing, grading, refurbishing, and final disposition.
    - Identify the specific actions, system interactions, and data points involved at each stage to ensure comprehensive coverage in the test.

2. **Develop the End-to-End Test Scenarios**:
    - Create detailed test scenarios that simulate the journey of a device through the entire FC process, including:
      - **Receiving**: Simulate the arrival of a device at the FC, including data capture and initial processing.
      - **Processing**: Test actions such as scanning, sorting, and recording device information in the system.
      - **Grading and Refurbishing**: Validate the grading process for device condition, potential refurbishment actions, and the updating of device status.
      - **Disposition**: Ensure the system correctly handles the final disposition of the device, whether it is recycled, refurbished, or resold.
    - Include variations in the test scenarios to cover different device conditions, processing paths, and outcomes.

3. **Automate the End-to-End Test**:
    - Use an automated testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, or custom scripts) to develop the end-to-end test, ensuring that it interacts with the system as a user or through API calls.
    - Implement assertions and validations at each stage of the process to verify that the system performs the expected actions and records accurate data.

4. **Execute and Validate the Test**:
    - Run the end-to-end test in a staging or test environment to ensure it covers the full FC process without impacting live operations.
    - Monitor the test execution to validate that each stage of the process is completed successfully and that any discrepancies or errors are identified.
    - Review test results to ensure that all expected outcomes are achieved and that the system handles various scenarios correctly.

5. **Document and Integrate the Test**:
    - Document the test scenarios, steps, and expected outcomes, including any variations or edge cases that were tested.
    - Integrate the end-to-end test into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure it is executed automatically as part of the deployment process, providing ongoing validation of the FC process.
    - Set up monitoring and alerting for the test execution to notify the team of any failures or issues detected during the test.

### Testing
- Execute the automated end-to-end test in a test environment to ensure that it accurately simulates the full FC process and validates each stage's functionality.
- Test the system's response to different scenarios, such as varying device conditions and processing paths, to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Validate the test results by comparing the expected and actual outcomes at each stage, including data accuracy, system actions, and final disposition.
- Review the test execution logs and any error reports to identify and address potential issues or discrepancies.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the FC system and test environment for executing the end-to-end test without affecting production operations.
- Collaboration with the operations and development teams to define the full FC process and validate the test scenarios.
- Integration with testing tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress) for developing and executing the automated end-to-end test.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have defined the full FC process workflow for a device, including all key stages and interactions.
- Should have developed detailed test scenarios that simulate the entire journey of a device through the FC process.
- Should have automated the end-to-end test using an appropriate testing framework, with validations at each stage.
- Should have executed the test in a staging environment, validated the results, and ensured it covers various scenarios and outcomes.
- Should have documented the test and integrated it into the CI/CD pipeline for ongoing validation.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Running End-to-End Test for  in FC Process
Given the implementation of an end-to-end test for the FC process,
When the test is executed,
Then it should simulate the full journey of a device through the FC process, validating each stage and confirming the correct final disposition.

#### Scenario: Validating System Actions and Data Accuracy
Given the execution of the end-to-end test,
When the test completes each stage,
Then it should verify that the system performs the expected actions and records accurate data throughout the process.

#### Scenario: Handling Different  Scenarios
Given the inclusion of variations in the test scenarios,
When the test simulates different device conditions and processing paths,
Then it should validate that the system handles each scenario correctly and produces the expected outcomes.
