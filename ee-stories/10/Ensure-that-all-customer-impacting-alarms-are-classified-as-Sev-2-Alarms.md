# Ensure that all customer impacting alarms are classified as Sev-2 Alarms
### Summary
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer, **I want** to ensure that all customer-impacting alarms are classified as Severity 2 (Sev-2) alarms, **So That** we can prioritize and respond to these incidents promptly, minimizing the adverse effects on customer experience and maintaining service reliability.

This story focuses on reviewing and classifying all existing customer-impacting alarms to ensure they are accurately categorized as Sev-2. By doing so, we can improve our incident response process, ensuring that issues affecting customers receive the appropriate level of urgency and attention.

### Vision
Classifying all customer-impacting alarms as Sev-2 will ensure a more efficient and effective incident response process, prioritizing issues that have a direct effect on customer experience. This categorization will facilitate quicker resolution of critical issues, helping maintain high service quality and customer satisfaction. The proactive approach will also enable us to allocate resources appropriately to address these alarms promptly.

### Background
Currently, there may be inconsistencies in how alarms are categorized, leading to delays in addressing issues that impact customers. Some customer-impacting alarms may not be classified as Sev-2, resulting in inadequate prioritization and slower response times. Ensuring that all such alarms are correctly classified will improve incident management and reduce the risk of prolonged customer impact.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to review, classify, and update all customer-impacting alarms to ensure they are categorized as Sev-2. This initiative supports the broader goal of enhancing the incident response process, reducing downtime, and improving the overall customer experience by ensuring timely attention to critical issues.

## Details
1. **Review Existing Alarms**:
    - Conduct a comprehensive review of all current alarms to identify those that directly impact customers, including those related to service availability, performance degradation, and critical functionality failures.
    - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to gather insights and validate the customer impact of each alarm.

2. **Classify Alarms as Sev-2**:
    - Reclassify identified customer-impacting alarms as Sev-2 to ensure they receive the appropriate level of attention and urgency.
    - Update the alarm configurations and documentation to reflect the new classification, including adding relevant metadata or tags for easy identification.

3. **Update Incident Response Protocols**:
    - Modify incident response protocols to prioritize Sev-2 alarms, ensuring that they are escalated and addressed promptly.
    - Define clear criteria for what constitutes a Sev-2 alarm to guide future alarm creation and classification.

4. **Integrate with Monitoring and Alerting Systems**:
    - Ensure that the reclassified Sev-2 alarms are integrated with monitoring and alerting tools (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) to enable immediate notifications to the on-call team.
    - Set up alert thresholds and escalation paths to ensure timely response and resolution of Sev-2 incidents.

5. **Training and Documentation**:
    - Update documentation to include the revised classification criteria and guidelines for identifying and handling Sev-2 alarms.
    - Provide training to the incident response team to ensure they are familiar with the new classification system and protocols.

### Testing
- Validate the reclassification of alarms by simulating customer-impacting scenarios to ensure that the Sev-2 alarms trigger correctly and notifications are sent to the appropriate teams.
- Test the integration with monitoring and alerting systems to confirm that Sev-2 alarms are prioritized and escalated according to the updated incident response protocols.
- Monitor the performance of the incident response process after implementing the changes to assess improvements in response times and resolution effectiveness.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the existing alarm configurations and monitoring tools for review and updates.
- Collaboration with development, operations, and customer support teams to identify and validate customer-impacting alarms.
- Integration with incident management tools for proper alerting and escalation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have conducted a comprehensive review of all existing alarms to identify those that impact customers.
- Should have reclassified all customer-impacting alarms as Sev-2 and updated the corresponding configurations and documentation.
- Should have integrated the reclassified Sev-2 alarms with monitoring and alerting systems to ensure immediate notification and escalation.
- Should have updated incident response protocols to prioritize and handle Sev-2 alarms effectively.
- Should have provided training and updated documentation to guide the team in identifying and managing Sev-2 alarms.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Reclassifying Customer-Impacting Alarms
Given the need to prioritize customer-impacting incidents,
When an alarm that affects customers is identified,
Then it should be classified as Sev-2 to ensure prompt response and resolution.

#### Scenario: Integrating Sev-2 Alarms with Alerting Systems
Given the reclassification of alarms as Sev-2,
When a Sev-2 alarm is triggered,
Then the monitoring and alerting system should send an immediate notification to the on-call team for action.

#### Scenario: Validating the Effectiveness of Sev-2 Classification
Given the reclassification of alarms,
When customer-impacting scenarios are simulated,
Then the Sev-2 alarms should trigger correctly, and the incident response process should activate promptly.
