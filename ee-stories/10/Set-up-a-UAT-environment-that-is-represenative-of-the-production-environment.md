# Set-up a UAT environment that is represenative of the production environment
### Summary
**As a** Development Team, **I want** to set up a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment that closely mirrors the production environment, **So That** we can ensure accurate and reliable testing before deploying to production.

This story aims to establish a UAT environment that replicates the production environment in terms of infrastructure, configurations, and data. This alignment will allow comprehensive testing, reduce deployment risks, and increase the reliability of our releases.

### Vision
The UAT environment is crucial for validating that the application behaves as expected in conditions similar to production. By creating a representative UAT environment, stakeholders and testers can identify potential issues and validate functionality, performance, and security. This ensures that any defects or discrepancies are addressed before the application goes live, resulting in a smoother and more predictable deployment process.

### Background
Currently, the UAT environment does not accurately reflect the production setup, which has led to inconsistencies and unforeseen issues during deployment. This misalignment increases the risk of undetected bugs and performance issues that could affect the user experience in production. An environment that matches production is essential to identify and resolve problems early, reducing the likelihood of post-release incidents.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this story is to mitigate the risk of production issues by providing a testing environment that accurately simulates real-world conditions. By ensuring that the UAT environment mirrors production, we aim to catch and resolve issues before deployment. This initiative supports the greater goal of maintaining high application quality and stability while improving confidence in the release process.

## Details
1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Clone the current production infrastructure, including server configurations, network settings, and software versions, to the UAT environment.
    - Ensure all services, databases, and external integrations in UAT are configured identically to those in production.

2. **Data Preparation**:
    - Create a sanitized data set that resembles production data, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.
    - Import this data into the UAT environment to support realistic testing scenarios.

3. **Access and Security**:
    - Implement security controls and user access permissions equivalent to the production environment.
    - Ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place to simulate real user interactions.

4. **Testing Tools Integration**:
    - Integrate testing and monitoring tools into the UAT environment to capture performance metrics and log data for analysis.
    - Set up automated deployment scripts to maintain consistency between UAT and production.

### Testing
- Validate the infrastructure setup by comparing UAT configurations with production.
- Run a suite of integration and regression tests in the UAT environment to ensure functionality matches production behavior.
- Perform load testing to verify that the UAT environment can handle expected traffic patterns.
- Conduct security testing to confirm that the environment meets production security standards.

### External Dependencies
- Access to production-like data that can be sanitized for use in the UAT environment.
- Coordination with the infrastructure team for provisioning resources.
- Availability of monitoring and testing tools to be integrated into the UAT environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a UAT environment set up that mirrors the production environment in terms of infrastructure and configurations.
- Should have production-like data imported into the UAT environment in a sanitized format.
- Should have security controls and user access permissions configured identically to production.
- Should have automated deployment scripts established to ensure consistency between UAT and production.
- Should have integrated testing and monitoring tools to facilitate comprehensive testing.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Setting up a UAT Environment
Given the need for a testing environment similar to production,
When the UAT environment is configured with production-like infrastructure and data,
Then it should support comprehensive testing and reveal potential issues before deployment.

#### Scenario: Data Compliance
Given the requirement for production-like data in UAT,
When the data is sanitized and imported,
Then it should comply with data privacy regulations while providing a realistic testing scenario.
