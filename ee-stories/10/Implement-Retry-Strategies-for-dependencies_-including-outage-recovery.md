# Implement Retry Strategies for dependencies, including outage recovery
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Team Lead, **I want** to implement proper retry strategies for dependencies, including outage recovery mechanisms, **So That** the system can handle transient failures and recover gracefully from outages without significant impact on overall functionality.

This story focuses on enhancing system resilience by introducing structured retry mechanisms for dependencies. These strategies will help manage temporary failures and improve the system's ability to recover from outages, minimizing service disruptions and improving overall reliability.

### Vision
By implementing retry strategies and outage recovery mechanisms, we aim to improve the system's fault tolerance and ensure that dependent services are more robust in the face of transient errors and outages. This will provide a smoother user experience by reducing the impact of temporary failures on end-users and maintaining operational continuity even during partial outages.

### Background
Currently, the system does not employ consistent retry strategies for handling dependency failures, which can result in immediate failures or prolonged service disruptions during outages. This lack of resilience can lead to degraded performance, customer dissatisfaction, and increased operational overhead for manual recovery. Implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and outage recovery mechanisms can mitigate these issues and enhance overall system stability.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to improve system resilience by ensuring that dependencies are handled more gracefully in the event of failures. Proper retry strategies will reduce the likelihood of cascading failures and service degradation, while outage recovery mechanisms will ensure that the system can quickly restore normal operations after an outage. This initiative aligns with the broader goal of delivering a reliable and high-performing system.

## Details
1. **Design Retry Strategies**:
    - Implement retry strategies for critical dependencies using techniques such as exponential backoff, jitter, and maximum retry limits to avoid overwhelming the dependent services.
    - Incorporate circuit breaker patterns to prevent retry storms and allow systems to fail fast when a dependency is experiencing prolonged outages.

2. **Outage Recovery Mechanisms**:
    - Implement mechanisms to detect when a dependency has recovered from an outage, such as health checks or monitoring system signals.
    - Ensure that services automatically resume normal operations and retry any failed requests once the dependency becomes available again.

3. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - Enhance error handling to capture and log detailed information about dependency failures, including the number of retries and failure reasons.
    - Implement alerts to notify the team when a dependency is experiencing repeated failures, enabling proactive investigation and resolution.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Develop test cases to simulate transient failures and outages, validating that the retry strategies and recovery mechanisms work as expected.
    - Perform load testing to ensure that retry mechanisms do not introduce additional strain on the system or dependencies during high-traffic periods.

### Testing
- Conduct unit and integration tests to verify that retry mechanisms handle transient failures correctly without causing cascading issues.
- Perform simulated outage tests to ensure that the system can detect and recover from dependency outages.
- Test the circuit breaker implementation to validate that it prevents excessive retries during prolonged outages and allows for graceful recovery.
- Monitor system logs and metrics during testing to verify correct implementation and identify any potential issues.

### External Dependencies
- Access to dependency services for integration and testing of retry mechanisms.
- Monitoring tools to track dependency health and signal recovery status.
- Alerting systems to notify teams of repeated dependency failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have implemented retry strategies for dependencies using exponential backoff, jitter, and maximum retry limits.
- Should have a circuit breaker mechanism in place to handle prolonged outages gracefully.
- Should have outage recovery mechanisms that automatically detect when dependencies become available and resume normal operations.
- Should have detailed error logging and alerting for dependency failures and retry attempts.
- Should have successfully tested retry strategies and outage recovery mechanisms through simulated failure scenarios.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Implementing Retry Strategies for Transient Failures
Given a dependency experiences a transient failure,
When the system encounters this failure,
Then it should retry the request using an exponential backoff strategy.

#### Scenario: Handling Prolonged Outages with Circuit Breaker
Given a dependency is experiencing a prolonged outage,
When the number of retry attempts exceeds the maximum limit,
Then the circuit breaker should trip, preventing further retries until the service is healthy.

#### Scenario: Automatic Recovery After Dependency Outage
Given a dependency was previously unavailable,
When the dependency becomes healthy again,
Then the system should resume normal operations and process any pending requests.
