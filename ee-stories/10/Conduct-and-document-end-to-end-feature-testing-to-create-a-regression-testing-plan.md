# Conduct and document end-to-end feature testing to create a regression testing plan
### Summary
**As a** Quality Assurance Engineer, **I want** to conduct and document end-to-end feature testing to create a regression testing plan, **So That** we can ensure that new features are thoroughly tested, minimize the risk of introducing defects into production, and maintain the stability and quality of the software over time.

This story focuses on performing comprehensive end-to-end testing of a feature, documenting the process, and creating a detailed regression testing plan. This includes data setup and pre-planning steps to ensure all aspects of the feature are covered and can be reliably tested in future regression cycles.

### Vision
End-to-end testing and a robust regression testing plan will provide a comprehensive approach to validating new features, ensuring that all integrated components work together as expected. By documenting these tests, we can create a reusable regression testing plan that will help catch any defects introduced by future changes, thus maintaining software quality and reducing the risk of production issues.

### Background
Currently, the testing process focuses on individual components or unit tests, which may not fully capture the interactions between different parts of the system. This can lead to integration issues and defects that go unnoticed until later stages or production. Conducting thorough end-to-end testing and creating a detailed regression testing plan will help identify and address these issues early, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to conduct and document end-to-end feature testing to establish a comprehensive regression testing plan. This plan will enable consistent and reliable testing of existing functionality when new changes are introduced, supporting the broader goal of maintaining high software quality and minimizing the impact of regressions.

## Details
1. **Pre-Planning and Data Setup**:
    - Identify the feature or set of features to be tested end-to-end, including all relevant components, services, and integrations.
    - Gather and prepare test data that accurately represents real-world scenarios, ensuring data privacy and compliance.
    - Set up the test environment to mirror production as closely as possible, including configurations, dependencies, and access permissions.

2. **Design End-to-End Test Cases**:
    - Develop detailed test cases that cover all aspects of the feature, including user interactions, backend processing, and integration points.
    - Include positive, negative, and edge case scenarios to thoroughly validate the feature's functionality and robustness.
    - Ensure that test cases are repeatable and can be automated where possible to facilitate future regression testing.

3. **Execute End-to-End Testing**:
    - Perform end-to-end testing according to the test cases, documenting the steps, expected outcomes, and actual results.
    - Record any issues or defects encountered during testing, including detailed information for debugging and resolution.
    - Validate that the feature works as intended in all scenarios, including handling errors and edge cases gracefully.

4. **Document Testing Process and Results**:
    - Create comprehensive documentation of the end-to-end testing process, including test case descriptions, data setup, and execution steps.
    - Include detailed results and observations for each test case, noting any discrepancies or areas for improvement.
    - Compile a summary of the testing outcomes, highlighting key findings and any actions taken to resolve issues.

5. **Develop Regression Testing Plan**:
    - Use the documented test cases and results to develop a regression testing plan that covers all critical aspects of the feature.
    - Define the scope, frequency, and execution process for regression testing, ensuring it can be integrated into the regular development cycle.
    - Include criteria for success, such as acceptable performance thresholds and error handling requirements, to guide future regression testing efforts.

### Testing
- Validate the accuracy and completeness of the end-to-end test cases by reviewing them with stakeholders and subject matter experts.
- Perform a dry-run of the regression testing plan to ensure that all test cases can be executed successfully and provide reliable results.
- Test the automation of end-to-end test cases to confirm they can be integrated into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- Review the documentation for clarity and completeness, ensuring it provides sufficient detail for future testing efforts.

### External Dependencies
- Access to the test environment and necessary configurations to mirror production.
- Collaboration with development and operations teams to set up and validate the test environment.
- Availability of test data that accurately represents real-world usage scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have completed end-to-end testing for the selected feature, covering all relevant scenarios and interactions.
- Should have documented the testing process, including detailed test cases, data setup, execution steps, and results.
- Should have developed a comprehensive regression testing plan based on the end-to-end test cases.
- Should have validated the regression testing plan through a dry-run to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.
- Should have created clear and detailed documentation to guide future regression testing efforts.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Conducting End-to-End Feature Testing
Given the need to validate a feature end-to-end,
When the test cases are executed,
Then all aspects of the feature should be thoroughly tested and documented, including interactions and edge cases.

#### Scenario: Creating a Regression Testing Plan
Given the completion of end-to-end testing,
When the testing results are documented,
Then a regression testing plan should be developed to ensure reliable validation of the feature in future releases.

#### Scenario: Validating the Regression Testing Plan
Given the creation of the regression testing plan,
When a dry-run is conducted,
Then the plan should be validated to ensure it can reliably detect regressions in the feature.
