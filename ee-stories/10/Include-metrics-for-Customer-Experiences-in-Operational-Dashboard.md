# Include metrics for Customer Experiences in Operational Dashboard
### Summary
**As a** Product Manager, **I want** to include customer experience metrics in the operational dashboard, **So That** we can monitor and improve the quality of service and user satisfaction more effectively.

Incorporating customer experience metrics into the operational dashboard allows for real-time tracking of key indicators such as response time, resolution rates, and customer feedback. This initiative is crucial for identifying areas of improvement and ensuring that the product meets customer expectations consistently.

### Vision
By integrating customer experience metrics into the operational dashboard, stakeholders can gain a holistic view of how the product performs from the user's perspective. This enhancement will enable proactive identification of trends and potential issues, fostering a data-driven approach to improving customer satisfaction and retention. It also ensures that the product team can quickly respond to any decline in customer experience metrics.

### Background
Currently, the operational dashboard focuses primarily on system health and technical performance metrics. While these are important, they do not provide a complete picture of the customer experience. This gap limits our ability to assess and improve how users interact with and perceive the product. Including customer experience metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and support ticket resolution time will give us a more comprehensive understanding of user satisfaction.

### Purpose
The inclusion of customer experience metrics aims to align operational monitoring with customer-centric goals. By integrating these metrics, we can directly measure the impact of our product's performance on customer satisfaction and identify actionable insights to enhance the user experience. This initiative supports the broader objective of delivering a product that not only meets technical standards but also delights customers and builds brand loyalty.

## Details
1. **Identify Relevant Metrics**:
    - Select key customer experience metrics such as NPS, CSAT, average resolution time for support tickets, and user engagement levels.
    - Define data sources and ensure consistent data collection methods for these metrics.

2. **Data Integration**:
    - Integrate data from customer feedback tools, support ticket systems, and user behavior analytics into the operational dashboard.
    - Ensure real-time data synchronization to provide up-to-date insights into customer experience.

3. **Dashboard Design**:
    - Design the dashboard layout to include a dedicated section for customer experience metrics.
    - Implement visualizations such as trend lines, pie charts, and heat maps to present the data effectively.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**:
    - Set up alerts for significant deviations in customer experience metrics (e.g., a drop in NPS or an increase in support ticket resolution time).
    - Implement notification mechanisms to inform relevant teams of potential issues requiring immediate attention.

5. **User Access and Permissions**:
    - Ensure that the appropriate stakeholders have access to the enhanced dashboard while maintaining data privacy and security.
    - Provide different views or levels of detail based on user roles.

### Testing
- Validate the accuracy of customer experience metrics displayed on the dashboard by cross-referencing with source systems.
- Test the real-time data integration to ensure timely updates of customer experience metrics.
- Perform user acceptance testing with stakeholders to confirm that the new metrics and visualizations meet their requirements.
- Test the alert and notification system to verify that it triggers correctly for predefined thresholds.

### External Dependencies
- Access to data from customer feedback tools (e.g., surveys, NPS scoring systems).
- Integration with support ticket systems to track resolution times.
- Availability of user behavior analytics tools for engagement metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have customer experience metrics (e.g., NPS, CSAT) integrated into the operational dashboard.
- Should have data from customer feedback tools and support systems synchronized in real-time on the dashboard.
- Should have visualizations that effectively present customer experience metrics for easy interpretation.
- Should have alert mechanisms set-up for significant deviations in customer experience metrics.
- Should have user access permissions configured to maintain data security and privacy.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Displaying Customer Experience Metrics on the Dashboard
Given the need to include customer experience metrics in the operational dashboard,
When the metrics are integrated and visualized,
Then the dashboard should provide real-time insights into user satisfaction and areas for improvement.

#### Scenario: Alert for Deviations in Customer Experience Metrics
Given the thresholds for customer experience metrics,
When a metric falls outside the defined range,
Then an alert should be triggered to notify the relevant team.
