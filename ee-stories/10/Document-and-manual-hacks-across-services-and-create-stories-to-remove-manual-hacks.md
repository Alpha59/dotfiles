# Document and manual hacks across services and create stories to remove manual hacks
### Summary
**As a** Software Development Manager, **I want** to document all manual hacks across services and create stories to address and remove these hacks, **So That** we can improve system reliability, maintainability, and automate processes to reduce manual interventions.

This story focuses on identifying, documenting, and planning the removal of manual hacks currently in place across services. By replacing these with automated, standardized solutions, we aim to enhance the system's stability and reduce the operational overhead caused by manual interventions.

### Vision
Documenting and addressing manual hacks will lead to a more robust and maintainable system by eliminating workarounds that can introduce instability and increase the risk of errors. By systematically identifying and resolving these hacks, we will streamline processes, reduce the potential for human error, and align the system with best practices. This initiative will also provide clear guidance for developers on how to address these hacks in future development efforts.

### Background
Over time, various manual hacks have been introduced into the system as quick fixes to address immediate issues. These hacks are often undocumented and can complicate maintenance, introduce technical debt, and increase the risk of errors during operations. Removing these manual interventions and replacing them with automated solutions will improve system reliability and efficiency.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to systematically document existing manual hacks and create a plan to replace them with automated, standardized solutions. This will reduce technical debt, enhance system maintainability, and improve operational efficiency by minimizing the need for manual interventions. This initiative aligns with the broader goal of maintaining a high-quality, sustainable software system.

## Details
1. **Identify Manual Hacks**:
    - Conduct a thorough review of the existing codebase, configurations, and operational procedures to identify all manual hacks and workarounds.
    - Collaborate with development and operations teams to gather information on any undocumented hacks that are in use.

2. **Documentation**:
    - Document each identified manual hack in detail, including its purpose, implementation, and impact on the system.
    - Include information on how the hack is triggered, what processes it affects, and any known issues or limitations it introduces.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
    - Assess the impact of each manual hack on system performance, reliability, and maintainability.
    - Prioritize hacks based on their impact and the complexity of removing them, focusing first on those that pose the highest risk or operational burden.

4. **Story Creation**:
    - Create individual stories for the removal of each manual hack, outlining the steps required to replace it with an automated solution.
    - Define clear acceptance criteria for each story, ensuring that the hack is fully removed and replaced with a reliable, maintainable solution.

5. **Implementation Planning**:
    - Develop a phased plan for implementing the stories, considering dependencies and potential impacts on the system.
    - Schedule regular reviews to track progress and address any challenges encountered during the removal process.

### Testing
- Validate the removal of each manual hack by verifying that the new automated solution functions as expected and does not introduce any regressions.
- Perform regression testing on affected services to ensure that the removal of hacks does not impact existing functionality.
- Monitor system performance and logs after each implementation to detect any unexpected issues.

### External Dependencies
- Input and expertise from development and operations teams to identify and document manual hacks.
- Access to the codebase, configuration files, and operational procedures for review.
- Coordination with stakeholders to schedule and implement changes in a controlled manner.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a comprehensive documentation of all identified manual hacks across services, including details on their implementation and impact.
- Should have individual stories created for each manual hack, outlining the steps for removal and replacement with an automated solution.
- Should have a prioritized plan for implementing the removal of hacks, considering system impact and dependencies.
- Should have verified the successful removal of each hack through testing and monitoring.
- Should have automated solutions implemented in place of manual hacks, improving system reliability and maintainability.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Identifying and Documenting Manual Hacks
Given the need to address manual hacks,
When a thorough review of the system is conducted,
Then all manual hacks should be documented with details on their purpose and impact.

#### Scenario: Creating Stories for Hack Removal
Given the identification of manual hacks,
When stories are created to remove these hacks,
Then each story should outline the steps for replacing the hack with an automated solution.

#### Scenario: Removing and Replacing Manual Hacks
Given the presence of manual hacks in the system,
When the hacks are replaced with automated solutions,
Then the system should function reliably without the need for manual interventions.
