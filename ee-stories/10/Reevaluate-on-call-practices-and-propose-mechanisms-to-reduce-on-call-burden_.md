# Reevaluate on-call practices and propose mechanisms to reduce on-call burden.
... Add all team members to rotation, and creating onboarding plan for on-call.

### Summary
**As a** Software Development Manager, **I want** to reevaluate the current on-call practices and propose mechanisms to reduce the on-call burden, **So That** we can ensure a more balanced workload, prevent burnout, and maintain a high level of system reliability. Additionally, **I want** to include all team members in the on-call rotation and create a comprehensive onboarding plan for new on-call duties.

This story aims to reassess and optimize on-call practices, distribute the on-call responsibilities more evenly among team members, and provide a structured onboarding process for effective on-call management.

### Vision
By reevaluating the on-call practices and reducing the burden on individual team members, we aim to create a more equitable and sustainable on-call system. This will help prevent burnout, improve morale, and maintain system stability by ensuring that all team members are adequately trained and prepared for on-call responsibilities. An effective onboarding plan will ensure that new members understand their roles and are equipped to handle incidents efficiently.

### Background
Currently, the on-call practices place a significant burden on a limited number of team members, leading to potential burnout and decreased productivity. The lack of a structured onboarding plan for new on-call duties can result in inconsistent incident handling and longer resolution times. By reevaluating and redistributing the on-call workload and providing comprehensive onboarding, we can improve the team's overall effectiveness and system reliability.

### Purpose
The purpose of this story is to create a balanced on-call rotation that includes all team members, implement mechanisms to reduce the overall on-call burden, and establish a clear onboarding plan for new on-call responsibilities. This initiative supports the broader goal of maintaining a healthy team dynamic, improving system uptime, and enhancing incident response capabilities.

## Details
1. **Evaluate Current On-Call Practices**:
    - Review the existing on-call schedule, incident logs, and team feedback to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
    - Analyze the frequency and nature of on-call incidents to determine opportunities for reducing on-call workload, such as automation or process improvements.

2. **Propose Mechanisms to Reduce On-Call Burden**:
    - Implement automated alerting and monitoring tools to filter out non-critical alerts and reduce noise.
    - Introduce runbooks and automated remediation scripts for common incidents to facilitate quicker resolution.
    - Establish clear escalation paths and criteria to ensure that only critical incidents require immediate attention.

3. **Redistribute On-Call Rotation**:
    - Create a balanced on-call rotation schedule that includes all team members, ensuring an equitable distribution of on-call duties.
    - Consider team member skill levels and expertise to ensure adequate coverage for different types of incidents.

4. **Develop an Onboarding Plan for On-Call**:
    - Create a comprehensive onboarding plan that includes training on incident management tools, processes, and best practices.
    - Include shadowing sessions for new on-call members to learn from experienced team members and gain hands-on experience.
    - Provide access to documentation, runbooks, and escalation procedures as part of the onboarding materials.

5. **Regular Review and Feedback**:
    - Schedule regular reviews of on-call practices and incident response effectiveness to identify areas for continuous improvement.
    - Gather feedback from team members to refine the on-call process and address any concerns or challenges.

### Testing
- Validate the effectiveness of the new on-call rotation by monitoring the distribution of incidents and overall team workload.
- Test the proposed mechanisms to reduce on-call burden by analyzing the frequency and resolution time of incidents after implementation.
- Conduct dry-run simulations with new on-call members to ensure they are adequately prepared and familiar with incident response procedures.
- Monitor feedback from team members during and after the onboarding process to identify any gaps or areas for improvement.

### External Dependencies
- Access to monitoring and alerting tools for configuration and integration.
- Collaboration with team members to gather feedback and insights on current on-call practices.
- Availability of incident management documentation and runbooks for onboarding materials.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have a revised on-call rotation schedule that includes all team members, ensuring a balanced distribution of duties.
- Should have mechanisms in place to reduce the on-call burden, such as automated alerting, runbooks, and clear escalation paths.
- Should have an onboarding plan developed and implemented for new on-call members, including training, documentation, and shadowing sessions.
- Should have successfully conducted dry-run simulations to validate the preparedness of new on-call members.
- Should have established a process for regular reviews and feedback on on-call practices to support continuous improvement.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Implementing a Balanced On-Call Rotation
Given the need to distribute on-call duties evenly,
When the new on-call rotation schedule is implemented,
Then all team members should be included, ensuring an equitable distribution of on-call responsibilities.

#### Scenario: Reducing On-Call Burden
Given the implementation of mechanisms to reduce on-call workload,
When non-critical alerts are filtered and automated solutions are in place,
Then the overall on-call burden should be reduced, and incidents should be resolved more efficiently.

#### Scenario: Onboarding for New On-Call Members
Given the onboarding plan for on-call responsibilities,
When new team members undergo training and shadowing sessions,
Then they should be adequately prepared to handle on-call incidents effectively.
