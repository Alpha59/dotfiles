# Add Necessary Metrics for Dependencies
### Summary
**As a** Product Owner, **I want** to include metrics for dependencies when introducing new functionality, **So That** we can monitor the impact on interconnected systems and ensure that all dependencies are functioning correctly.

Incorporating dependency metrics is crucial for assessing the impact of new features on existing systems and services. This will allow us to identify potential bottlenecks, performance issues, or failures that could arise due to the new functionality, ensuring a seamless integration into the current ecosystem.

### Vision
By integrating metrics for dependencies into the monitoring process of new functionality, we aim to provide a holistic view of system performance. This enables stakeholders to understand how the new functionality interacts with other components, ensuring that interdependencies are managed effectively. This initiative will facilitate proactive identification of issues, allowing for timely interventions to maintain system stability and performance.

### Background
Currently, when new functionality is introduced, the focus is primarily on direct performance metrics, often overlooking the potential impact on dependent systems and services. This lack of visibility into dependencies can lead to unexpected failures, degraded performance, or cascading issues in the production environment. Incorporating dependency metrics will help in early detection of such issues, reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.

### Purpose
The main purpose of including dependency metrics is to ensure that any new functionality introduced does not adversely affect other components of the system. By monitoring these metrics, we can ensure that the integration of new features is smooth and that any negative impacts on dependencies are quickly identified and mitigated. This supports the broader goal of delivering high-quality, reliable software that integrates seamlessly into the existing environment.

## Details
1. **Identify Key Dependencies**:
    - List all internal and external dependencies related to the new functionality, including APIs, databases, third-party services, and internal modules.
    - Determine critical metrics for each dependency, such as response time, error rates, throughput, and resource utilization.

2. **Metrics Integration**:
    - Integrate the identified dependency metrics into the existing monitoring framework.
    - Ensure that metrics are captured in real-time and are accessible via the operational dashboard.

3. **Monitoring and Visualization**:
    - Set up monitoring tools to collect and visualize dependency metrics, providing insights into the health and performance of each dependency.
    - Implement visualizations such as dashboards and graphs to display metrics like latency, error rates, and system load for each dependency.

4. **Alerting and Notifications**:
    - Configure alerts for any anomalies or thresholds breaches in dependency metrics (e.g., increased error rates or latency).
    - Ensure notifications are sent to the relevant teams for prompt investigation and resolution.

5. **Data Retention and Analysis**:
    - Implement data retention policies to store historical dependency metrics for trend analysis and reporting.
    - Use historical data to identify patterns or recurring issues that could impact new functionality.

### Testing
- Validate the accuracy of dependency metrics by cross-referencing with data from source systems and services.
- Test the integration of metrics into the monitoring framework to ensure real-time data capture.
- Perform a series of tests with the new functionality to monitor its impact on dependencies and verify that metrics are accurately reflected on the dashboard.
- Test the alerting system to confirm it triggers correctly for any anomalies in dependency metrics.

### External Dependencies
- Access to monitoring tools and systems capable of tracking the identified dependency metrics.
- Integration with internal and external services to collect relevant metrics.
- Availability of the operational dashboard to display and analyze metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Should have identified and integrated key dependency metrics into the monitoring framework.
- Should have visualizations on the operational dashboard displaying real-time metrics for dependencies.
- Should have an alerting system set up to notify teams of any anomalies in dependency metrics.
- Should have a data retention policy in place to store historical metrics for analysis.
- Should have verified that the new functionality does not negatively impact dependencies based on the collected metrics.

### Gherkin
#### Scenario: Monitoring Dependencies for New Functionality
Given the introduction of new functionality,
When dependency metrics are integrated and monitored,
Then the system should provide real-time insights into the performance and health of dependencies.

#### Scenario: Alert for Dependency Issues
Given the thresholds for dependency metrics,
When a metric exceeds the defined limits,
Then an alert should be triggered to notify the relevant team for investigation.
