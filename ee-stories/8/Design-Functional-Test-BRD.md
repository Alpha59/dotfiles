# Design: Functional Test BRD
## Summary:
As a developer I want my functional tests to test that our code is properly functioning so that I am not bogged down by FTs breaking pipelines, and mismanaged code repositories.

## Purpose:
In order to improve our overall pipeline goals, and improve our code quality, we want our functional tests to test all of the various workflow cases, causes, and possible missed cases before code is pushed to production.

## Details:
The goal of this story is to create a Business oriented document which includes all of the required test cases for FTs. This will working with the business to come up with a comprehensive description of the scenarios which need to be accounted for. In order to do this, I would recommend isolating use cases from past BRD documents, and writing out each scenario as a set of steps that need to be tested. This should be written from both an FC associate, and Business User standpoint.

This will also include a recommendation of FT architecture to migrate our FTs into a single FT suite.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* Does this story require any code changes? No.
* Does this design require a design doc? Yes.
* Does this design include creating new stories? Yes.
