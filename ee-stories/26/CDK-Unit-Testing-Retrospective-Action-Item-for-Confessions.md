# CDK Unit Testing - Retrospective Action Item for  Confessions
## Summary
**AS a** Software Developer
**I WANT** to create unit tests for CDK (Cloud Development Kit) Constructs
**SO** we can ensure the reliability and correctness of our infrastructure code.

## Additional Context
Unit testing is a crucial practice in software development to validate the behavior of code and catch bugs early in the development process. Our CDK Constructs form the foundation of our infrastructure code, and it is essential to have comprehensive unit tests to verify their functionality. By creating unit tests for our CDK Constructs, we can increase our confidence in the stability and correctness of our infrastructure deployments.

This story should only apply to DRC at this point.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Should have identified the CDK Constructs that require unit tests.
- Should have created unit test files for each CDK Construct, following the naming convention and structure of our testing framework.
- Should have written unit tests to cover the expected behavior and edge cases of each CDK Construct.
- Should have ensured that the unit tests are isolated, independent, and focused on testing the specific functionality of the CDK Constructs.
- Should have used appropriate testing libraries and frameworks, such as Jest or Mocha, to write and execute the unit tests.
- Should have included assertions to verify the expected outcomes of the CDK Constructs' methods and properties.
- Should have mocked external dependencies or resources to isolate the CDK Constructs for testing.
- Should have executed the unit tests to verify that they pass successfully, indicating the correctness of the CDK Constructs.
- Should have documented the purpose and coverage of each unit test, explaining the scenarios and inputs being tested.
- Should have ensured that the unit tests provide sufficient code coverage for the CDK Constructs, aiming for a high percentage of coverage.
- Should have conducted peer reviews of the unit tests to gather feedback and ensure their effectiveness.
- Should have addressed any identified issues or failures in the unit tests, making necessary corrections or adjustments.
- Should have documented the process and guidelines for writing and maintaining unit tests for CDK Constructs, providing a reference for future development efforts.
- Should have established a practice of writing unit tests for all new CDK Constructs and updating existing unit tests as code changes are made.
