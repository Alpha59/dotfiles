 When you write, don't use first-person or second-person perspectives. Avoid weasel words, passive language, filler words, unconscious bias, emotional tones, indirect sentences, adverbs, adjectives, subjunctive mood, ambiguous euphemisms, comparative illusions, lazy words, beholder words, and gendered pronouns:

## Key Issues Identified:
* * Use of First-Person Plural (we, us, our):
*     * First-person plural diminishes objectivity and formality. Using third-person language enhances professionalism and impartiality.
*     * Replace "We conducted the research" with "The research team conducted the research."
* * Inconsistent Acronym Format (M-AWS, N-AWS):
    * Consistent formatting for acronyms avoids confusion and maintains a uniform style.
    * Use the hyphenated acronym format (e.g., N-AWS).
* Use of Passive Voice:
    * Passive voice makes sentences less direct and challenging to follow. Active voice is clear and dynamic.
    * Replace "The report was submitted by the team" with "The team submitted the report."
* Sentences with Multiple Ideas:
    * Combining multiple ideas in one sentence makes it difficult to follow. Single-idea sentences improve clarity and focus.
    * Split "Since the team is busy, it also needs more time" into "The team is busy. It needs more time."
    * Use of Indirect Language (believe, can, could, generally, hope, might, need to, planning on):
* Indirect language weakens statements. Direct language is assertive and assured.
    * Replace "might" with "will."
    * Clear and Precise Language:
    * Vague terms lead to misunderstandings. Specific language enhances clarity and precision.
    * Replace "many" with "a significant number" or "a large proportion."
* Avoid Bias and Discrimination:
    * Inclusive language respects diversity and promotes equality.
    * Replace "chairman" with "chairperson."
* Avoid Filler Words:
    * Filler words clutter the text and reduce impact. Removing them makes writing more concise.
    * Replace "be able to" with "can."
* Avoid Long Sentences:
    * Long sentences can overwhelm the reader. Shorter sentences enhance readability.
    * Split "The team completed the project, which involved several complex tasks, in a short time frame due to their exceptional skills and dedication" into: "The team completed the project, which involved complex tasks. They did this in a short time frame due to their exceptional skills and dedication."
    * Separate Bulleted Lists by Lines:
* Properly formatted bulleted lists improve organization and readability.
    * Instead of writing "1)Item one, 2)item two, 3)item three" in a single line, format it as:
        * Item one
        * Item two
        * Item three

Maintaining high writing standards is essential for numerous reasons. Good writing ensures that documents are clear, professional, and readable. This is particularly important when documents are distributed to a wider audience, including stakeholders and external partners. A well-written document reflects positively on the team and demonstrates a commitment to quality and professionalism.

Moreover, adhering to these standards from the outset is streamlined compared to revising documents that have been written poorly. When documents do not meet the team standards, it requires additional time and effort to correct them, which delays updates and reduces productivity. Writing the document correctly the first time maintains the level of quality required, and saves time and resources when writing the document each month.

Moving forward, commit to following these practices to avoid creating a mess that requires additional effort to correct. If you need any clarification on these guidelines, please do not hesitate to ask.
