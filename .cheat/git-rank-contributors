## git-rank-contributors: a simple script to trace through the logs and
## rank contributors by the total size of the diffs they're responsible for.
## A change counts twice as much as a plain addition or deletion.
##
## Output may or may not be suitable for inclusion in a CREDITS file.
## Probably not without some editing, because people often commit from more
## than one address.
#
#Outputs just the name and email of the contributors
#Adding -v will output the number of changes made by the user
