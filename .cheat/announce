NAME
    announce - Announce a message using voice, notification, and ASCII art

SYNOPSIS
    announce [MESSAGE]

DESCRIPTION
    The announce function takes a message and announces it through multiple
    channels: text-to-speech, system notification, and ASCII art. It uses the
    'say' command for voice output, 'notify' for system notifications, and
    'cowsay' for a fun ASCII art representation.

OPTIONS
    MESSAGE
        The message to be announced. Can be multiple words.

EXAMPLES
    announce "Hello, world!"
    announce "Your task is complete"

SEE ALSO
    say(1), notify(1), cowsay(1)

NOTES
    This function requires the 'say', 'notify', and 'cowsay' commands to be
    installed and accessible in the system's PATH.

Breakdown:

1. announce () { ... }: Defines a function named announce.

2. say "$@": Uses the 'say' command to convert the input message to speech. "$@" expands to all arguments passed to the function, preserving quotes and spaces.

3. notify "$@": Calls a custom 'notify' function (or command) to display a system notification with the input message.

4. cowsay "$@": Uses the 'cowsay' command to display the input message in an ASCII art speech bubble, typically with a cow character.

The function relies on external tools:
- say: A text-to-speech command (commonly available on macOS).
- notify: A custom function or command for displaying system notifications.
- cowsay: A program that generates ASCII art, usually a cow with a speech bubble.

This function provides a multi-modal way to announce messages, combining auditory, visual, and fun elements to ensure the message is noticed and remembered.
