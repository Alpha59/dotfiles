NAME
    pipx - Install and run Python applications in isolated environments

SYNOPSIS
    pipx [options] <command> [args]

DESCRIPTION
    pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. It creates isolated environments for each application to ensure they don't interfere with each other or your system Python installation.

COMMANDS
    install         Install a package
    inject          Install packages into an existing pipx-managed environment
    upgrade         Upgrade a package
    upgrade-all     Upgrade all packages
    uninstall       Uninstall a package
    uninstall-all   Uninstall all packages
    reinstall       Reinstall a package
    reinstall-all   Reinstall all packages
    list            List installed packages
    run             Run a command from a package
    runpip          Run pip in an existing pipx-managed environment
    ensurepath      Ensure pipx is on PATH
    completions     Print instructions for installing shell completions

OPTIONS
    --version       Show the version and exit
    -h, --help      Show this help message and exit
    --verbose       Show more output
    --quiet         Show less output
    --python PYTHON Use a specific Python version for the pipx-managed environment

USAGE
    Use pipx to install Python applications globally while keeping them isolated.

EXAMPLES
    pipx install pycowsay
    pipx run pycowsay moo
    pipx list
    pipx upgrade-all

OUTPUT
    Varies depending on the command, but generally provides feedback on the operations performed.

BREAKDOWN
pipx is a Python-based tool, not a bash script. When invoked, it interprets the command and options provided, then performs the requested operation, such as installing a package in an isolated environment or running a command from an installed package.

SUGGESTED ADDITIONS
1. Create a bash wrapper script for pipx to add custom functionality:
   - Add a --clean option to remove all cached downloads and temporary files
   - Implement a --backup option to create a backup of all installed packages and their versions
   - Add a --restore option to restore from a backup
   - Create a --update-self option to update pipx itself
   - Implement a --doctor option to check for common issues and suggest fixes
   - Add a --search option to search for available packages
   - Create a --info option to show detailed information about an installed package
   - Implement a --export option to generate a requirements.txt file for all installed packages
