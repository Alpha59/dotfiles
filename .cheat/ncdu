NAME
    ncdu - NCurses Disk Usage

SYNOPSIS
    ncdu [options] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
    ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It allows users to interactively browse directories and see which files and folders are using the most disk space.

    -v                  Print version
    -q                  Quiet mode, refresh interval 2 seconds
    -x                  Don't cross filesystem boundaries
    -e                  Enable extended information
    -r                  Read only mode
    -o FILE             Export scanned directory to FILE
    -f FILE             Import scanned directory from FILE
    -0                  End filenames with \0 instead of \n
    -1                  Use SI units (powers of 1000 instead of 1024)
    -2                  List file sizes using powers of 2
    --exclude PATTERN   Exclude files that match PATTERN
    --exclude-from FILE Read exclude patterns from FILE
    --confirm-quit      Confirm quitting ncdu
    --color SCHEME      Set color scheme (off/dark/dark-bg)

USAGE
    Run ncdu in a directory to analyze its disk usage interactively.

EXAMPLES
    ncdu
    ncdu /home
    ncdu -x /
    ncdu -o usage.dat /var
    ncdu -f usage.dat

OUTPUT
    An interactive ncurses interface showing directory structure and file sizes.

BREAKDOWN
ncdu is a compiled C program. When run, it scans the specified directory (or the current directory if none is specified), calculates disk usage, and presents an interactive interface for exploring the results.
