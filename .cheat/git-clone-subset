Usage: git-clone-subset [options] <repository> <destination-dir> <pattern>
USAGE

Clones a <repository> into a <destination-dir> and runs on the clone
git filter-branch --prune-empty --tree-filter 'git rm ...' -- --all
to prune from history all files except the ones matching <pattern>,
effectively creating a clone with a subset of files (and history) of the
original repository.

Useful for creating a new repository out of a set of files from another
repository, migrating (only) their associated history. Very similar to
what git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter does, but for a file
pattern instead of just a single directory.
