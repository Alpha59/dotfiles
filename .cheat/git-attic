git-attic [-M] [PATH] - list deleted files of Git repositories

Use -M to not show renamed files, and other git-log options as you like.

The output is designed to be copy’n’pasted: Pass the second field to
git show to display the file contents, or just select the hash without ^ to
see the commit where removal happened
