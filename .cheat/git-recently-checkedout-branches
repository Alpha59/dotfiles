BREAKDOWN
1. Shebang and usage information in comments
2. Set -e to exit on error
3. Check for -h flag to display help
4. Initialize variables (seen and git_dir)
5. Use git reflog to get recent checkouts
6. Process each line of the reflog output:
   - Extract date and branch name
   - Check if branch has been seen before
   - Verify if branch still exists
   - Print date and branch name if conditions are met

SUGGESTED ADDITIONS
1. Add a -n option to specify the number of entries to display
2. Implement a --format option for custom output formatting
3. Add a --since option to filter by date
4. Include a --color option for colorized output
5. Implement a --sort option to change sorting order (e.g., alphabetical)
