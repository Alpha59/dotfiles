Makes a program fullscreen.

The Program needs to be specified by the name in
the "/Applications/" folder, without the ".app".

This is useful for programatically making something fullscreen,
even if the current process is running in the background

    EXAMPLES:
    fullscreen Warp 0
    fullscreen "Google Chrome" 0
    fullscreen "Google Chrome" 1
