Monitors Chrome tab deployment

NAME
    wait-deployment - Monitor a Chrome tab for deployment changes

SYNOPSIS
    wait-deployment [TAB_IDENTIFIER]

DESCRIPTION
    The wait-deployment function monitors a specific Chrome tab for changes,
    typically used to track the progress of a deployment. It uses the chrome-cli
    tool to retrieve information about the specified tab and displays it
    continuously using the watch command.

OPTIONS
    TAB_IDENTIFIER
        A string used to identify the desired Chrome tab. This is passed to the
        find-tab function to locate the correct tab.

EXAMPLES
    wait-deployment "My Deployment Page"

SEE ALSO
    chrome-cli(1), watch(1), find-tab(1)

NOTES
    This function requires the chrome-cli tool to be installed and accessible
    in the system's PATH.

Breakdown:

1. wait-deployment () { ... }: Defines a function named wait-deployment.

2. tab=$(find-tab "$*"): Calls the find-tab function with all arguments passed to wait-deployment, storing the result (presumably a tab ID) in the 'tab' variable.

3. echo "$tab": Prints the tab ID or identifier.

4. watch chrome-cli info -t "$tab": Uses the watch command to repeatedly run chrome-cli info with the -t option and the tab ID. This continuously displays information about the specified tab, allowing the user to monitor changes.

The function relies on external tools:
- find-tab: A custom function to locate a Chrome tab based on given criteria.
- chrome-cli: A command-line interface for Google Chrome.
- watch: A Unix command that runs a specified command periodically.
