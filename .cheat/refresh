NAME
    refresh - Reload Chrome tabs with local URLs

SYNOPSIS
    refresh

DESCRIPTION
    This AppleScript searches through all open Google Chrome windows and tabs,
    identifying tabs with URLs containing "127.0.0.1" or "localhost". It then
    reloads these tabs and prints their URLs. The script returns 0 if any local
    tabs were found and reloaded, or 1 if no local tabs were found.

OPTIONS
    None

EXIT STATUS
    0   At least one local tab was found and reloaded
    1   No local tabs were found

EXAMPLES
    ./refresh

SEE ALSO
    osascript(1), Google Chrome

NOTES
    This script is designed to run on macOS and requires Google Chrome to be installed.

Breakdown:

1. #!/usr/bin/osascript: Shebang indicating this is an AppleScript.

2. on run argv: Defines the main function that runs when the script is executed.

3. set done to 1: Initializes a flag to indicate if any local tabs were found (1 = no, 0 = yes).

4. tell application "Google Chrome": Targets the Google Chrome application.

5. set window_list to every window: Gets all Chrome windows.

6. Nested loops to iterate through all windows and tabs.

7. For each tab:
   - Checks if the URL contains "127.0.0.1" or "localhost"
   - If found, prints the URL, sets done to 0, and reloads the tab
   - If not found, just prints the URL

8. return done: Returns 0 if local tabs were found and reloaded, 1 otherwise.

This script is useful for developers working on local web projects, allowing them to quickly refresh all local development tabs across multiple Chrome windows.
