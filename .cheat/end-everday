This is a program to be run at the end of the working
day to clean-up any open work, and sign-off.

Requires a number of other scripts to exist before it can be
used properly.

    EXAMPLES:
# Prints version information
end-everday --version;
# Runs script in verbose mode
end-everday -v;
# Runs script in quiet mode
end-everday -q;
# pipes output into a file
end-everday -o file.txt;
