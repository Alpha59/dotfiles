NAME
    autopep - Run autopep8 with predefined options

SYNOPSIS
    autopep [FILE_OR_DIRECTORY...]

DESCRIPTION
    The autopep function is a wrapper for the autopep8 Python code formatter.
    It runs autopep8 with specific options to format Python code in-place,
    recursively, and with an aggressive level of formatting.

OPTIONS
    FILE_OR_DIRECTORY
        One or more Python files or directories containing Python files to be
        formatted. If a directory is specified, all Python files within it will
        be processed recursively.

EXAMPLES
    autopep myfile.py
    autopep project_directory/

SEE ALSO
    autopep8(1), python(1)

NOTES
    This function requires autopep8 to be installed and accessible in the
    system's PATH. It can be installed via pip: pip install autopep8

Breakdown:

1. autopep () { ... }: Defines a function named autopep.

2. autopep8 -i -r -a -a "$@": Runs the autopep8 command with specific options and passes all arguments given to the autopep function.

   Options used:
   - -i: In-place formatting (modifies files directly)
   - -r: Recursive (processes directories recursively)
   - -a -a: Aggressive level 2 (applies more formatting fixes)
   - "$@": Expands to all arguments passed to the function, preserving quotes and spaces

The function simplifies the use of autopep8 by providing a preset configuration. This is useful for maintaining consistent code formatting across projects or for quickly formatting Python code without having to remember specific autopep8 options.
