     -g therm shows thermal conditions that affect CPU speed. Not available on all platforms.
     -g thermlog shows a log of thermal notifications that affect CPU speed. Not available on all platforms.
     -g assertions displays a summary of power assertions. Assertions may prevent system sleep or display sleep. Available 10.6 and later.
     -g assertionslog shows a log of assertion creations and releases. Available 10.6 and later.

     -g historydetailed Prints driver-level timings for a sleep/wake. Pass a UUID as an argument.
     -g powerstate [class names] Prints the current power states for I/O Kit drivers. Caller may provide one or more I/O Kit class names (separated by spaces) as an argument. If
     no classes are provided, it will print all drivers' power states.
     -g powerstatelog [-i interval] [class names] Periodically prints the power state residency times for some drivers. Caller may provide one or more I/O Kit class names
     (separated by spaces). If no classes are provided, it will log the IOPower plane's root registry entry. Caller may specify a polling interval, in seconds with -i <polling
     interval>; otherwise it defaults to 5 seconds.
